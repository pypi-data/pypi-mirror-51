# brat-widget

$brat-widget is a Jupiter Widget library for BRAT visualization and text annotation. This is an extension of original BRAT, 
an intuitive web-based tool for text annotation supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. 

## Features

- Comprehensive visualization
- Intuitive Annotation Interface
- High-quality Annotation Visualisation
- Always saved, always up to date
- Fully configurable
- NLP Technology Integration

## Implementation

BRAT has been developed for rich structured annotation for a variety of NLP tasks and aims to support manual curation 
efforts and increase annotator productivity using NLP techniques. 
$brat-widget is implemented using Jupyter Notebook technology with the intention of create and share documents that 
contain embedded code and execution results to help the annotators to gain skills on NLP and Corpus that they need. It has 
been implemented using a client-server architecture with communication over HTTP using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). 
The server is a RESTful web service and the tool can easily be extended or adapted to switch out the server or client.

## Installation

For development purposes, you need [npm 3.10](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [node.js 6.11](https://nodejs.org/es/) installed,
and some python packages than can be see it in the following list of steps using
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) as package-enviroment manager.

Install $brat-widget by running:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 env
source ./env/bin/activate
pip install ipywidgets
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
pip install twine
```

The easiest way to star playing with the widget is using the reinit.sh script that is
included in this project. Assuming that you have your virtualenv environment already activated
(the second step in the list above `source ./env/bin/activate`), you have the following
options:

- `./reinit.sh -c`: clear all the npm installations made previously, prepare the
brad-widget python package from the scratch, and install it.
- `./reinit.sh -s`: prepare the brad-widget python package (previously downloaded
javascript packages are reused), install it, and start jupyter notebook.
- `./reinit.sh -s -c` or `./reinit.sh -sc`: clear all the npm installations made previously,
prepare the brad-widget python package from the scratch, install it, and start jupyter notebook.
- `./reinit.sh -d -c` or `./reinit.sh -dc`: clear all the npm installations made previously,
prepare the brad-widget python package from the scratch, install it, and start jupyter notebook in such a way
that any change to js file will be reflected in the UI.

## Usage

Once $brat-widget installed, a new browser window (or a new tab) is started showing the 
Notebook Dashboard.  A sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select 
which notebook to open.

Now, you can navigate through web interface tree and select Notebooks folder. 
There in you can run the `Test.ipynb` notebook.

Additional actions can be performed:

- You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
- You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
- To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart.
This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch.

## Packaging

In order to generate a new package version and distribute it follow the next steps:

- Install Twine: `pip install twine`
- Packaging:
    * Optional: git add and git commit
    * `jupyter labextension uninstall brat-widget`
    * `jupyter nbextension uninstall --sys-prefix brat_widget`
    * `pip uninstall -y brat-widget`
    * `./dev-clean.sh`
    * `python setup.py build`
    * `cp -r ./js/brat_widget/static ./brat_widget/`
    * `python setup.py sdist`
    * `python setup.py bdist_wheel`
    * Check description: 
        - `pip install readme_renderer`
        - `twine check dist/*`
    * Upload distribution: `twine upload dist/*`
    * Upload to npm:
        - `pushd js`
        - `git clean -fdx`
        - `npm install`
        - `npm pack`
        - Optional: `npm adduser`
        - `npm publish`
        - `popd`
    * Optional: update _version.py (add 'dev' and increment minor)
    * Optional: git add and git commit
    * Optional: `git tag -a 0.2.4 -m "comment"`

    Base class for View. Designed to operate as a list
    of Card objects, modeling a deck of playing cards.
    Builds a list of Cards when it is initialized. Defaults
    to building a standard 52 card deck, though custom
    specifications are allowed. Built-in specifications
    include "ace_high" and "face_cards_are_ten".

    Attributes:
        specifications: A list of intialization options
            or a custom dictionary detailing exactly how the
            Deck should be built. See terminal_playing_cards.config.DEFAULT_DECK_SPEC
            for an example of how to build a custom dictionary.
            Defaults to a standard 52 card deck. For example:

            from terminal_playing_cards import Deck

            standard_deck = Deck()
            # Initialize all aces with a value of 13

            # Initialize all face cards with a value of 10
            face_ten_deck = Deck(specifications=["face_cards_are_ten"])
            # Build a deck with just an ace of clubs with a value of 1
            # and two of hearts with a value of 2
            special_specs = {"A": {"clubs": 1}, "2": {"hearts": 2}}
            special_deck = Deck(specifications=special_specs)
        kwargs: Card initialization options.
            Current options include:
                - hidden: Boolean determining if the
                    Card should be hidden when printed to
                    the terminal. Defaults to False.
                - picture: Boolean determining if a picture
                    should be included when designing face
                    cards (J, Q, K). Defaults to True.

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        DrDigit requires Python 3.5 or later.
        
        Concept
        -------
        
        The tests are based on the statistics of digits which are assumed to have a
        uniform distribution. Near-uniform distributions can be obtained by looking
        at the last digits of sufficiently large values - such as vote counts
        (possibly above 100).
        
        On a smaller scale, you can query for the probablity of a digit sequence using
        probability mass functions represented by Python functions.
        
        There are larger scale tests for a sequence of digit groups. This is so to
        support situations where different groups are expected to be doctored by
        different people - testing for an overarching, consistent anomaly could be too
        strict in such cases.
        
        Based on the current features (entropy, digit repetition, coincident digits in
        parallel sequences), it is possible to sort a data frame containing digit groups
        by probability, so then it is possible to inspect if there is any apparent
        sanity behind the doctoring.
        
        A couple of advice
        ------------------
        
        * Handle results with care, there is always some uncertainity
        * Try to focus on interesting groups, this should yield much sharper results
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        DrDigit can be installed using pip:
        
            $ pip install drdigit-brezniczky
        
        More to come ...

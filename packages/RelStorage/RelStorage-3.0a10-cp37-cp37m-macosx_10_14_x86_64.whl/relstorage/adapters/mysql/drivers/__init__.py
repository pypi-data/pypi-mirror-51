        Some drivers need extra arguments to execute a statement that
        returns multiple results, and they don't all use the standard
        way to retrieve them, so use this.

        Returns a list of lists of rows, one list for each result set::

            [
              [(row in first),  ...],
              [(row in second), ...],
              ...
            ]

        Note that, because 'CALL' potentially returns multiple result
        sets, there is potentially at least one extra database round
        trip involved when we call ``cursor.nextset()``. If the
        procedure being called is very short or returns only a single
        very small result, this may add substantial overhead.

        As of PyMySQL 0.9.3, mysql-connector-python 8.0.16 and MySQLdb
        (mysqlclient) 1.4.2 using libmysqlclient.21.so (from mysql8)
        or libmysqlclient.20 (mysql 5.7), all the drivers use the
        flags from the server to detect that there are no more results
        and turn ``nextset()`` into a simple flag check. So if the CALL
        only returns one result set (because the CALLed object doesn't
        return any of its own, i.e., it only has side-effects) there
        shouldn't be any penalty.

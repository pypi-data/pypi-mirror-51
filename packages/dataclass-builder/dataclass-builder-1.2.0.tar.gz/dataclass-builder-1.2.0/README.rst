Create instances of Python dataclasses with the builder pattern.


Requirements
------------

* Python 3.6 or greater
* dataclasses_ if using Python 3.6


Installation
------------

`dataclass-builder` is on PyPI_ so the easiest way to install it is:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install dataclass-builder


Usage
-----

There are two ways to use `dataclass-builder`.  Via a builder instance or by creating a dedicated builder.  The latter is recommended when repeated building of a given dataclass is desired or when docstrings and type checking are important.


Dedicated Builder (builder factory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using specialized builders allows for better documentation than the `DataclassBuilder` wrapper.

.. code-block:: python

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from dataclass_builder import (dataclass_builder, build, fields, update
                                   REQUIRED, OPTIONAL)

    @dataclass
    class Point:
        x: float
        y: float
        w: float = 1.0

    PointBuilder = dataclass_builder(Point)

Now we can build a point.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = PointBuilder()
    >>> builder.x = 5.8
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> builder.w = 2.0
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=2.0)

As long as the dataclass_ the builder was constructed for does not have a `build` field then a `build` method will be generated as well.

    >>> builder.build()
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=2.0)

Field values can also be provided in the constructor.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = PointBuilder(x=5.8, w=100)
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> builder.build()
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=100)

*Positional arguments are not allowed.*

Fields with default values in the dataclass_ are optional in the builder.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = PointBuilder()
    >>> builder.x = 5.8
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> builder.build()
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=1.0)

Fields that don't have default values in the dataclass_ are not optional.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = PointBuilder()
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> builder.build()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MissingFieldError: field 'x' of dataclass 'Point' is not optional

Fields not defined in the dataclass cannot be set in the builder.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder.z = 3.0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UndefinedFieldError: dataclass 'Point' does not define field 'z'

*No exception will be raised for fields beginning with an underscore as they are reserved for use by subclasses.*

Accessing a field of the builder before it is set gives either the `REQUIRED` or `OPTIONAL` constant

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = PointBuilder()
    >>> builder.x
    REQUIRED
    >>> builder.w
    OPTIONAL

The `fields` method can be used to retrieve a dictionary of settable fields for the builder.  This is a mapping of field names to `dataclasses.Field` objects from which extra data can be retrieved such as the type of the data stored in the field.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(builder.fields().keys())
    ['x', 'y', 'w']
    >>> [f.type.__name__ for f in builder.fields().values()]
    ['float', 'float', 'float']

A subset of the fields can be also be retrieved, for instance, to only get required fields:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(builder.fields(optional=False).keys())
    ['x', 'y']

or only the optional fields.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(builder.fields(required=False).keys())
    ['w']


If the underlying dataclass_ has a field named `fields` this method will not be generated and instead the `fields` function should be used instead.

An already built dataclass_ can be updated with a partially completed builder using the :code:`update` function.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> point = Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=100)
    >>> update(point, PointBuilder(y=1.1))
    >>> point
    Point(x=5.8, y=1.1, w=100)

*Dataclass builders can also be updated, but frozen dataclasses cannot.*


Builder Instance (generic wrapper)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using a builder instance is the fastest way to get started with the `dataclass-builder` package.

.. code-block:: python

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from dataclass_builder import (DataclassBuilder, build, fields,
                                   REQUIRED, OPTIONAL)

    @dataclass
    class Point:
        x: float
        y: float
        w: float = 1.0

Now we can build a point.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.x = 5.8
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> builder.w = 2.0
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=2.0)

Field values can also be provided in the constructor.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point, x=5.8, w=100)
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=100)

.. note::

    Positional arguments are not allowed, except for the dataclass_ itself.

Fields with default values in the dataclass_ are optional in the builder.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.x = 5.8
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=1.0)

Fields that don't have default values in the dataclass_ are not optional.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> build(builder)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MissingFieldError: field 'x' of dataclass 'Point' is not optional

Fields not defined in the dataclass cannot be set in the builder.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder.z = 3.0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UndefinedFieldError: dataclass 'Point' does not define field 'z'

.. note::

    No exception will be raised for fields beginning with an underscore as they are reserved for use by subclasses.

Accessing a field of the builder before it is set gives either the `REQUIRED` or `OPTIONAL` constant

.. code-block:: python

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.x
    REQUIRED
    >>> builder.w
    OPTIONAL

The `fields` function can be used to retrieve a dictionary of settable fields for the builder.  This is a mapping of field names to `dataclasses.Field` objects from which extra data can be retrieved such as the type of the data stored in the field.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(fields(builder).keys())
    ['x', 'y', 'w']
    >>> [f.type.__name__ for f in fields(builder).values()]
    ['float', 'float', 'float']

A subset of the fields can be also be retrieved, for instance, to only get required fields:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(fields(builder, optional=False).keys())
    ['x', 'y']

or only the optional fields.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(fields(builder, required=False).keys())
    ['w']

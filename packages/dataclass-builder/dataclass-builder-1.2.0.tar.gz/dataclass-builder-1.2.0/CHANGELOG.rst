Changelog
=========


Unreleased_
-----------


v1.2.0_ - 2019-08-21
--------------------

* Add :code:`update` function to facilitate updating a dataclass or dataclass
  builder from a partially completed dataclass builder.


v1.1.3_ - 2019-08-07
--------------------

* Switch to reST docstrings and remove paramref requirement.
* Fix bug in dataclass builders that contains a field named fields.
* Fix return type annotation of the build method.
* Fix issue `#12`_ which would cause sentinel values :code:`REQUIRED`,
  :code:`OPTIONAL`, and :code:`MISSING` to become incomparable after
  a :code:`copy` or :code:`deepcopy`.


v1.1.2_ - 2019-03-29
--------------------

* Fix issue `#9`_ relating to the :code:`dataclass_builder` factory function
  failing to handle dataclasses which use types from the :code:`typing` module.
* Replace equality checks with identity checks where possible.  This was not
  only the intention of the checks but by using identity, compatibility with
  types that have broken equality operators is restored.


v1.1.1_ - 2019-03-27
--------------------

* Fix bug where the :code:`MISSING` constant was not exported at the package
  level.


v1.1.0_ - 2019-03-27
--------------------

* Make :code:`MISSING` constant comparable (True) with :code:`REQUIRED` and
  :code:`OPTIONAL` constants.


v1.0.1_ - 2019-03-26
--------------------

* Fixed trove classifiers.


v1.0.0_ - 2019-03-26
--------------------

*First stable release.*

**BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**

* Moved :code:`REQUIRED` and :code:`OPTIONAL` constants into :code:`._common`
  with exports at the package level.
* Fixed bug in :code:`DataclassBuilder.__repr__` causing some types of fields
  such as strings to not display properly.
* Rewrite :code:`DataclassBuilder` to share functions with the factory
  version :code:`dataclass_builder`.
* Change how :code:`DataclassBuilder` handles unset fields so that they will
  be initialized to :code:`REQUIRED` and :code:`OPTIONAL` in order to be
  compatible with the classes returned from the :code:`dataclass_builder`
  factory.
* Fields passed in the :code:`__init__` method of :code:`DataclassBuilder` will
  now raise :code:`TypeError` (instead of :code:`UndefinedFieldError`) the same
  as classes build with the :code:`dataclass_builder` factory.
* Disabled positional arguments for builders generated with the
  :code:`dataclass_builder` factory.
* Fixed documentation mismatches.  The documentation both in the README and in
  the module docstrings properly reflect the API.


v0.0.3_ - 2019-03-26
--------------------

* Added :code:`.factory.dataclass_builder` factory function to create builder
  classes for specific dataclasses.
* Moved :code:`build` and :code:`fields` functions to the :code:`.utility`
  submodule with exports at the top level.
* Moved :code:`DataclassBuilder` to the :code:`.wrapper` submodule with exports
  at the top level.
* Fixed issue #4 which caused typing errors in code using
  :code:`DataclassBuilder`.


v0.0.2_ - 2019-03-12
--------------------

* Added additional unit tests.
* Fixed issue #1 preventing :code:`DataclassBuilder` from being subclassed.
* Fields beginning with an underscore will no longer be checked.


v0.0.1 - 2019-03-11
-------------------

* Added :code:`DataclassBuilder` class to wrap Python dataclasses_ with a
  factory implementing the builder pattern.
* Added :code:`build` function to construct a dataclass_ from a
  :code:`DataclassBuilder`.
* Added :code:`fields` function to extract information about the available
  fields from a :code:`DataclassBuilder`.

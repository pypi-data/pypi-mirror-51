"""Create instances of :func:`dataclasses.dataclass` with the builder pattern.

This module uses a generic wrapper that becomes specialized at initialization
into a builder instance that can build a given dataclass.

Examples
--------
Using a builder instance is the fastest way to get started with
the `dataclass-builder` package.

.. testcode::

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from dataclass_builder import (DataclassBuilder, build, fields,
                                   REQUIRED, OPTIONAL)

    @dataclass
    class Point:
        x: float
        y: float
        w: float = 1.0

Now we can build a point.

.. doctest::

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.x = 5.8
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> builder.w = 2.0
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=2.0)

Field values can also be provided in the constructor.

.. doctest::

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point, x=5.8, w=100)
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=100)

.. note::

    Positional arguments are not allowed, except for the dataclass itself.

Fields with default values in the dataclass are optional in the builder.

.. doctest::

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.x = 5.8
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> build(builder)
    Point(x=5.8, y=8.1, w=1.0)

Fields that don't have default values in the dataclass are not optional.

.. doctest::

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.y = 8.1
    >>> build(builder)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MissingFieldError: field 'x' of dataclass 'Point' is not optional

Fields not defined in the dataclass cannot be set in the builder.

.. doctest::

    >>> builder.z = 3.0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UndefinedFieldError: dataclass 'Point' does not define field 'z'

.. note::

    No exception will be raised for fields beginning with an underscore as they
    are reserved for use by subclasses.

Accessing a field of the builder before it is set gives either the `REQUIRED`
or `OPTIONAL` constant

.. doctest::

    >>> builder = DataclassBuilder(Point)
    >>> builder.x
    REQUIRED
    >>> builder.w
    OPTIONAL

The :func:`fields` function can be used to retrieve a dictionary of settable
fields for the builder.  This is a mapping of field names to
:class:`dataclasses.Field` objects from which extra data can be retrieved such
as the type of the data stored in the field.

.. doctest::

    >>> list(fields(builder).keys())
    ['x', 'y', 'w']
    >>> [f.type.__name__ for f in fields(builder).values()]
    ['float', 'float', 'float']

A subset of the fields can be also be retrieved, for instance, to only get
required fields:

.. doctest::

    >>> list(fields(builder, optional=False).keys())
    ['x', 'y']

or only the optional fields.

.. doctest::

    >>> list(fields(builder, required=False).keys())
    ['w']

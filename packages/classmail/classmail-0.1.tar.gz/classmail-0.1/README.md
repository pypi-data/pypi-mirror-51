# ClassMail

![alt text](classmail_logo.png "Classmail icon") Classmail

Mail classification Python library optimized for french mails in the field of insurance. Classmail was created to automate mail classification workflow in quick experiments. Developped during my internship at [Covéa](https://www.covea.eu).

Classmail provides:

* **Data visualisation:** For quick data analysis, based on matplotlib and seaborn

* **Mails preprocessing (cleaning):** Optimised for inasurrance purposes, with prebuilt regular expressions (in french). This configuration file can be adapted for other languages or purposes.

* **Deep learning model creation (for classification):** Simple interface to build Pytorch models quickly based on [Flair](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair) nlp library.

* **Model analysis and explainer** Simple interface with prebuilt seaborn graphs and model explainer based on [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).


## Quick Start

### Requirements and Installation

The project is based on Python 3.7+.
If you do not have Python 3.6, install it first. 
Then, in your favorite virtual environment, simply do:

```
pip install classmail
```

### Example Usage

Let's run named entity recognition (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a `Sentence`, load 
a pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:


* Data analysis
    ```python
    import classmail.data_visualisation.data_visualisation as dv

    # show class balancing graph
    dv.plot_class_balancing(data,col_text='header_body',col_label="COMPETENCE", title="Catégories des mails")
    #show most frequent bigrams
    dv.plot_word_frequencies(data['message'],ngram=2,words_nb=20)
    #plot a wordcloud with most frequent terms in body
    dv.plot_wordcloud(data['body'])
    ```

    
* Cleaning
    ```python
    from classmail.nlp.cleaning import clean_mail

    #create a new column in data ("clean_text") with preprocessed header and body
    data = clean_mail(data,"body","header")
    ```

* Model creation and training
    ```python
    from classmail.classification.trainer import Trainer
    
    trainer = Trainer()
    #generate train / test / val csv files
    trainer.prepare_data(data, col_text="clean_text",col_label="COMPETENCE", train_size=0.7, val_size=0.15, test_size=0.15)

    #create a new column in data ("clean_text") with preprocessed header and body
    data = clean_mail(data,"body","header")

    #train a model with default parameters
    trainer.train_model(model_name="default_model")
    ```

* Model predictions, evaluation and explaination
    ```python
    from classmail.classification.model import Model

    #load our model, saved in "ressources" folder
    model = Model("ressources\\model_default")
    #predictions
    predictions=model.get_predictions(X_test)
    #confusion matrix
    model.plot_confusion_matrix(pred_labels=predictions, true_labels=y_test)
    #explain one exemple at index 110
    model.visualize_one_ex(X_test,y_test,index=110,num_features=6)
    #compute most discriminants words in each category
    sorted_contributions = model.get_statistical_explanation(X_test, ["class 1","class 2","class 3"] sample_size=15)
    #plot them for first class
    model.plot_discriminant_words(sorted_contributions, "class 1", nb_words=15)
    ```

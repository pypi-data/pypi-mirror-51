Description: # Skua
        ### A pythonic static site generator.
        A static site generator written in Python. 
        ### Command-line interface
        Skua can be used from the command line (still under development). It takes every template it finds and places an HTML template in the chosen output folder. 
        ### Python scripting
        Skua can be imported and used to create Python scripts, which allows for greater flexibility and custom site generation pipelines. 
        ### Versioning
        Skua version numbers are in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
        
        * MAJOR: A major release will include breaking API changes and old code will need to be ported over to a new version. 
        * MINOR: A minor release will be backwards compatible with all code on the same MAJOR version.
        * PATCH: This is a small release to fix something within the latest MINOR version. It does not introduce new functionality.

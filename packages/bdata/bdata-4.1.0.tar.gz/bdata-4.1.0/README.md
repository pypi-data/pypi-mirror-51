# bdata
Beta-data package. The bdata object is largely a data container, designed to read out [MUD](http://musr.ca/mud/mud_fmt.html) data files and to provide user-friendly access [BNMR/BNQR data](http://musr.ca/mud/runSel.html). 

## Setup 

* Install using pip: `pip install bdata`
* Export environment variables for finding data files (add to `.bashrc` or similar)
   Set environment variables BNMR_ARCHIVE and BNQR_ARCHIVE such that one 
   can access the msr files according to the following scheme:
   ```bash
      ${BNMR_ARCHIVE}/year/filename
      ${BNQR_ARCHIVE}/year/filename
   ```

## Object Map

**Signature**: 

`bdata(run_number,year=None,filename='')`

Examples:
    
```python
bd = bdata(40001)                     # read run 40001 from the current year. 
bd = bdata(40001,year=2017)           # read run 40001 from year 2017.
bd = bdata(0,filename='filename.msr') # read file from local memory, run number unused 
```        

**Functions**: 

| Signature | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| `asym(option="",omit="",rebin=1,hist_select='')`     | Calculate asymmetry. See below for docstring.     |
| `beam_kev()`     | Get beam implantation energy in keV     |
| `get_pulse_s()`     | Get beam pulse duration in s     |


## Misc Features

### Representation

   Representation has been nicely formatted so that typing the object 
   name into the interpreter produces nice output. 

### Operators

   bvar, bscaler, and bhist objects allow for arithmatic or logic 
   operators to be used, where the value used in the operation is the 
   mean, count, or data array respectively. 

   Example:    `bd.ppg.bias15 + 1`
   is equivalent to 
               `bd.ppg.bias15.mean + 1`

### Special Rules For Attributes

   If an attribute is not found in bdata, it will look for the 
   attribute in the bdict objects in the order: camp, epics, ppg, hist.
   This second-level attribute search is much slower than regular 
   access.

   bdict objects all allow assignment and fetching of dictionary keys 
   as if they were attributes. Note that one can replace `+` with `p`,
   and `-` with `m` to allow fetching of histograms. 

   Example: `bd.ppg.beam_on`, `bd.ppg['beam_on']`, `bd.beam_on` all have the 
            exact same output, with the last being much slower than 
            the others.

## bdata.asym() docstring

```text
usage: asym(option="",omit="",rebin=1,hist_select='')

Inputs:
    options:        see below for details
    omit:           1f bins to omit if space seperated string in options 
                        is not feasible. See options description below.
    rebin:          SLR only. Weighted average over 'rebin' bins to 
                        reduce array length by a factor of rebin. 
    hist_select:    string to specify which histograms get combined into 
                        making the asymmetry calculation. Deliminate 
                        with [,] or [;]. Histogram names cannot 
                        therefore contain either of these characters.

Asymmetry calculation outline (with default detectors) ---------------

    Split helicity      (NMR): (F-B)/(F+B) for each
    Combined helicity   (NMR): (r-1)/(r+1)
        where r = sqrt([(B+)(F-)]/[(F+)(B-)])

    Split helicity      (NQR): (R-L)/(R+L) for each
    Combined helicity   (NQR): (r-1)/(r+1)
        where r = sqrt([(L+)(R-)]/[(R+)(L-)])

    Alpha diffusion     (NQR) sum(AL0)/sum(L+R)
    Alpha tagged        (NQR) same as NQR, but using the tagged counters

Histogram Selection ---------------------------------------------------

    If we wished to do a simple asymmetry calculation in the form of 

                            (F-B)/(F+B)

    for each helicity, then 
                               |--|  |--|   paired counter location
                hist_select = 'F+,F-,B+,B-'
                                |-----|       paired helicities
                                   |-----|

    for alpha diffusion calculations append the two alpha counters

        hist_select = 'R+,R-,L+,L-,A+,A-

    for alpha tagged calculations do the following

        hist_select = 'R+,R-,L+,L-,TR+,TR-,TL+,TL-,nTR+,nTR-,nTL+,nTL-'

        where TR is the right counter tagged (coincident) with alphas, 
              TL is the left  counter tagged with alphas, 
             nTR is the right counter tagged with !alphas (absence of), 
             nLR is the right counter tagged with !alphas, 


Status of Data Corrections --------------------------------------------
    SLR/2H: 
        Removes prebeam bins. 

        Rebinning: 
            returned time is average time over rebin range
            returned asym is weighted mean

    1F: 
        Allows manual removal of unwanted bins. 

        Scan Combination:
            Multiscans are considered as a single scan with long 
            integration time. Histogram bins are summed according to 
            their frequency bin, errors are Poisson.

    1N:
        Same as 1F. Uses the neutral beam monitor values to calculate 
        asymetries in the same manner as the NMR calculation. 

    2E: 
        Prebeam bin removal. 
        Postbeam bin removal. Assumes beamoff time is 0. 
        Splits saved 1D histograms into 2D.

        Asymmetry calculations: 
            raw: calculated through differences method (as described in 
                the asymmetry calculation outline)
            dif: let 0 be the index of the centermost scan in time. dif 
                asymmetries are then calculated via raw[i+1]-raw[i-1], 
                where "raw" is as calculated in the above line, for each 
                of the three types: +,-,combined 
            sl: take a weighted least squares fit to the two bins prior 
                and the two bins after the center bin (in time). For 
                each find the value of the asymmetry at the center time 
                position. Take the difference: post-prior

# coda-to-end
coda-to-end is a Python package which includes several end to end algorithms for Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA).

The user inputs the compositional data and the feature vector (either real numbers for regression, or class indices for classification).

For regression problems, the CodaRegress class is used, while classification problems will call the CodaClass class.

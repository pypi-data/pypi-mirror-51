            $ batch_tar

            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -l <file>             path list to be dealed with
              -L [<str> [<str> ...]]
                                    basenames of files/subdirecotries in `-workdir`. If
                                    `-workdir` was not specified, `-workdir ./` is
                                    assumed.
              -workdir <directory>  working directory. must specify `-regex` together
              -tarfile <str>        group all the files/subdirecotries into one file.tar
                                    (.bz2 or .gz). only works with `-L` and `-workdir`
              -regex <str>          deal with only the files/subdirecotries in `-l` or
                                    `-workdir` whose basenames match the regular
                                    expression
              -compress {z,j}       For the subdirecotries, when executing `tar -cf`, also
                                    add parameter `z` or `j` for `tar` command. The files
                                    will always be gzipped if this option was not set.
              -rm                   delete the files/subdirecotries when tar finishs.
              -p                    only print out the commands, not run. then you can use
                                    qsub-sge.pl to submit multiple jobs. Useful to handle
                                    a lot of files because I run in single thread mode
                                    only! [False]
              --version             show program's version number and exit

====================================
Register a lead directly in an event
====================================

This module allows to register a lead directly in an event when converting
this lead into a partner, so that you can save several steps.

Usage
=====

Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings* and check "Use leads if you need a
qualification step before creating an opportunity or a customer" option.

Go to any lead in *Sales > Sales > Leads*, and click on the button "Convert
to Opportunity".

In the resulting screen, if the conversion action is "Convert to opportunity"
and you have selected a related partner (a new or an existing one), you will
have a section called "Event registration".

In that section, you can select an event, and when you click on
"Create opportunity", the partner will be registered automatically in the
event.

In any moment, you can also set a registration for an event by clicking on
button "Generate registration", located in tab "Extra info" in marketing
section in any lead or opportunity.

## Features
pyifx contains 4 main modules, giving users access to functions such as:
<ul>
	<li>HSL Modification</li>
	<li>Convolution-based functions</li>
	<li>Image format conversion & resizing</li>
	<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>

pyifx also allows for images to be read in from directories instead of individually importing them, allowing for image modification processes to be automated.

A full list of features is available in the [user guide & documentation](https://pyifx.readthedocs.io).

## Code Example
The code block below perfectly details the use of the library.

``` python
#demo_file.py
import pyifx

# Creating the image
image = pyifx.misc.PyifxImage(input_path="path/to/img.png", output_path="path/to/new_img.png")

# Creating the volume
volume = pyifx.misc.ImageVolume(input_path="lots/of/images/", output_path="lots/of/images/modified/", prefix="_")

#Creating the list
image_2 = pyifx.misc.PyifxImage(input_path="different/path/to/img.png", output_path="different/path/to/new_img.png")
image_list = [image, image_2]

brightened_image = pyifx.hsl.brighten(image, 50)
brightened_list = pyifx.hsl.brighten(image_list, 50)
```

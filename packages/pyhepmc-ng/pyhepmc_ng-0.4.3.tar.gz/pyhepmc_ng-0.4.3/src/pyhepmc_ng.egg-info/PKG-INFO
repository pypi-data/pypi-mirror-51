Description: 
        A Python wrapper for the HepMC3 C++ library.
        
        Another wrapper is [pyhepmc](https://pypi.org/project/pyhepmc/). Why should you use this one?
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is easy to install**
        
        The command `pip install pyhepmc-ng` just works! You only need a compiler that
        supports C++11, everything else is handled by pip.
        
        Under the hood, the bindings are build with the excellent
        [pybind11](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library. External installations of pybind11 or HepMC3 are not required, pyhepmc-ng includes the lightweight source code of both libraries with the submodule feature of `git`.
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is actively developed**
        
        pyhepmc-ng is part of the Scikit-HEP project, which aims to provide all tools needed by particle physicists to do data analysis in Python. It is also gets official support from the HepMC3 project.
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is unit tested**
        
        Everything in pyhepmc-ng is unit tested.
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is Pythonic**
        
        pyhepmc-ng is a hand-crafted mapping of C++ code to Python. It supports Python idioms
        where appropriate.
        
        - C++ methods which act like properties are represented as properties,
          e.g. GenParticle::set_status and GenParticle::status are mapped to a single
          GenParticle.status field in Python
        - Tuples and lists are implicitly convertible to FourVectors
        - Vectors of objects on the C++ side are mapped to Python lists
        - ReaderAscii and WriterAscii support the context manager protocol
        - A convenient `open` function is provided for reading and writing HepMC files
        
        ## Documentation
        
        pyhepmc-ng currently has no separate documentation, but it mirrors the C++ interface of the HepMC3 library, which is documented here: http://hepmc.web.cern.ch/hepmc.

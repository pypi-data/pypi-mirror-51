Installation
============

To install dynamic_pytables_where_condition run::

    $ pip install dynamic_pytables_where_condition

Usage examples
==============

Quick start::

    >>> from dynamic_pytables_where_condition import construct_where_condition

    >>> construct_where_condition()
    ''

    >>> construct_where_condition(t_b_min=4.0, t_b_max=8.0, a_min=2000.0)
    '(a >= 2000.0) & (t_b <= 8.0) & (t_b >= 4.0)'

    >>> construct_where_condition(t_b_fix=4.0, t_b_max=None, a_min=None)
    '(t_b == 4.0)'

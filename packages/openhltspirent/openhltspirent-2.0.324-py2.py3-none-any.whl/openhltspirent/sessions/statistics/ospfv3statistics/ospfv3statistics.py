		 DOWN    Initial state of a neighbor conversation. It indicates that therehas been no
		         recent information received from the neighbor.
		 ATTEMPT This state is only valid for neighbors attached to non-broadcastnetworks. It
		         indicates that no recent information has been received from theneighbor, but that
		         a more concerted effort should be made to contact the neighbor. This is done by
		         sending the neighbor Hello packets at intervals ofHelloInterval.
		
		 INIT    An Hello packet has recently been seen from the neighbor. However,bidirectional
		         communication has not yet been established with the neighbor(the router itself
		         did not appear in the neighbor's Hello packet). Allneighbors in this state (or higher)
		         are listed in the Hello packets sentfrom the associated interface.
		
		 TWOWAYS Communication between the two routers is bidirectional. This has been assured by the
		         operation of the Hello Protocol. This is the mostadvanced state short of beginning
		         adjacency establishment. The BackupDesignated Router (BDR) is selected from the set
		         of neighbors in the TWOWAYSstate or greater.
		
		 EXSTART This is the first step in creating an adjacency between the twoneighboring routers.
		         The goal of this step is to decide which router is the master, and to decide upon
		         the initial database description (DD) sequencenumber. Neighbor conversations in this
		         state or greater are calledadjacencies.
		
		 EXCHANGE In this state the router is describing its entire link statedatabase by sending
		         Database Description packets to the neighbor. EachDatabase Description Packet has
		         a DD sequence number, and is explicitlyacknowledged. Only one Database Description
		         Packet is allowed outstanding atany one time. In this state, Link State Request Packets
		         may also be sentasking for the neighbor's more recent advertisements. All adjacencies in
		         Exchange state or greater are used by the flooding procedure. In fact, these adjacencies
		         are fully capable of transmitting and receiving all types of OSPF routing protocol packets.
		         Loading Link State Request packets are sent to the neighbor asking for themore recent
		         advertisements that have been discovered (but not yet received)in the Exchange state.
		
		 FULL    Neighboring routers are fully adjacent. These adjacencies will nowappear in router
		         links and network links advertisements.

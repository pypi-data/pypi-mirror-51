Very quickly load pandas DataFrames in Excel

Python is awesome and I love it for doing all sorts of data manipulation. But sometimes Microsoft Excel remains the best place to do quick data exploration and filtering. So thanks to the brilliant [xlwings](xlwings), it's easy to integrate the two. This module has some very simple functions to make this as easy as possible.

Say you have this script:

```python
>>> df = read_data()
>>> result = df.groupby("blah")[vars].agg(something_complex)
```

And you want to explore ``result`` quickly in Excel, you can do the following. This and all the following examples will immediately launch the DataFrame in a new Excel Workbook on your desktop via a non-blocking call.

```python
>>> from excellentpandas import show_in_excel
>>> df = read_data()
>>> result = df.groupby("blah")[vars].agg(something_complex).pipe(via_excel)
>>> show_in_excel(result)
>>>
```

Better:

```python
>>> from excellentpandas import via_excel
>>> df = read_data()
>>> result = df.groupby("blah")[vars].agg(something_complex).pipe(via_excel)
>>>
```

My favourite also prints ``df.info()`` to the console:

```python
>>> from excellentpandas import via_info_excel
>>> df = read_data()
>>> result = df.groupby("blah")[vars].agg(something_complex).pipe(via_info_excel)
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

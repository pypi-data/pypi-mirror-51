Our Portrait represents her Highness in a dress worn on public occasions. The two men sitting with her were her Ministers. The one on the right, in the white dress, is Kian Ram, the Under Minister, and a Hindoo; and the one on the left is Jumal-oo Deen,the Prime Minister, and a Mussulman. The town of Bhopal is in Central India, between Saugor and Indore, on the Bombay road, and nearly equidistant from both places about 109 miles. The population is chiefly Mussulman; but a great number of Hindoos live in the town and are treated in all respects as well as the Musaulmans. The late ruler of the Bhopal State, her Highness the Nawab Secunder Begum, was daughter of the late Nawab Nuzzer Mahomed Khan. She married her cousin, the late Jehan gir Mahomed Khan. After his death she succeeded him, with the consent of the British authorities, and proved one of the wisest and most able rulers of the country. The reigning family at Bhopal have always been attached to the British; and when the mutiny broke out she remained firm in her attachment to the English cause in spite of the wishes and entreaties of her intimate friends and relations and the threats of her Mussulman adherents. She stood alone in our favour at that trying time, and had the wisdom and foresight to know that in the end we must be the conquerors. Whatever assistance she could give us, she gave willingly. In 1860, after, the country was settled, the late-Lord Canning assembled all the chiefs of Central India at Jubbulpoor, and in open durbar there praised the Begum for the noble way in which she had stood out in our favour, and at the same time informed her that he had been empowered to give her a grant of land worth about a ]ac of rupees a year. The Begum was greatly affected on this occasion, and with tears of joy in her eyes stood up and tanked his Lordship for the great honour she had received. On her way back from Jubbulpoor, as she was crossing the noble iron suspension-bridge over the Baas, eleven miles from Saugor (built by a former Commissioner of Saugor, from iron made on the spot, from the ore found in the neighbourhood, with ordinary native tools, and by unskilled workmen and at a place where no foundries exist), she said, \"Of what use is it to fight against people who can build a bridge like this?\"\\n', 'om', '20190816_124120']" .

Bhopal is a small and obscure State of Central India, and the Princess, its ruler, buzzes about it like a bee in a bonnet. She indulges in no fashionable laziness at the Capital, nor does she permit the existence of any Ring government; on the contrary, she makes tours of inspection through her domains and metes out punishment and affords redress with her own tinted hands. Under her unfaltering eye the grocers of Bhopal have an exceedingly hard time; their weights and measures are tested, and, if they prove defective, the Government destroys them and kindly provides new ones, and Messieurs the grocers pay for them. She exercises stern discipline in all other matters of morals; she has nearly paid off a national debt of 700,000 rupees; and she contemplates the building of a railroad. Imagining her to be one of the princess\\'s attendants, I advancedindifferently to meet the young girl; but with a gesture full of dignity she stopped me, raying, \"I am Shah Jehan! \"I paused a moment in amazement, and bowed profoundly; and my astonishment may be conceived on finding myself suddenly in the presence of the Princess whom I imagined to be still strictly confined to her harem. Nevertheless, recovering somewhat from my surprise, I addressed my compliments of condolence to her, telling her how during the short time that I had known Prince Oumra Doula I had learned to esteem and even to like him. Without attempting to feign the slightest emotion, the young Princess put a stop to my praises, saying, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, the simple word \"Kismet! \"(It was written). Then, motioning me to seat myself near her on one of the sofas, she said abruptly to me, \"Do you come from Paris ? \"and I was compelled, without taking breath, to give a description of Paris, its monuments and the manners of its inhabitants. I could not get over my bewilderment, and was almost shocked at this utter want of feeling, when the Begum Secunder arrived. She could not help smiling on remarking my astonishment, and, having seated herself beside us, said to me \"I mourn for Oumra Doula because I lose in him a faithful friend and counsellor. But why should my daughter mourn ? Does the prisoner regret his gaoler? \"Strange words these from the lips of\\nWith reference to this description by M. L.

Accompanied by her son, Prince Sahin-Szada, three ladies of her court and nineteen attendants she made a swift decent from the boat into a saloon carriage which had been drawn up directly opposite to the gangway. Nothing but a fleeting glimpse of Oriental silk wraps and veils of white and green was to be seen, not even the captain of the vessal being allowed near the gangway. Sultana Jehan, the Begum of Bhopal, has many claims to be regarded as a unique figure among Oriental rulers. She is the only woman to rule in a Mohammedan country and she is the third woman of her line to do so, having succeeded her mother in 1910, and besides she is very brightly educated and an able administrator of Bhopal, a State in the centre of India founded in the seventeenth century by her ancestor Dost Mohammed Khan. The rulers of this State have always been friendly to England from the day when a treaty of dependence was signed between the ruler and the British Government in 1818, and later in 1872, when Shah Jahan the Begum of Bhopal, received the Grand Cross of the Star of India, to present day which sees the Princess of Bhopal leaving her native land for the distant England in her wish to attend the coronation of the King Emperor. In this she has shown her spirit of independent activity, for the neighbour the Nizam of Hydrabad has never crossed the water. Sultan Jehan takes the most active part in government of Bhopal. Her interest in education and especially the education of the women of her native country, is very great, but besides this she supervises the work of the various Government departments and acts as judge in all appeals. Eight years ago when Lord Curzon was crowned Viceroy of India, the Princess Than insisted upon being present and presenting to the Viceroy a jewelled casket containing an address assuring the British Government not only of the fidelity off her country but of that of the whole of the Mohammedan population of India, for, she said, faithfulness and obedience to the ruler are both strictly ordained by the Mohammedan religion. Two East Indian women of note are the Shah Jehan Begum, the ruler of Bhopal and Miss Soonderbai Powar, who has devoted her life to the suppression of the opium traffic. Her highness the begum is noted for her loyalty to England, for which she has been decorated by Queen Victoria. She is very small, scarcely taller than a well grown child of ten. She is about fifty years of age, and her bright face is a true index of her intelligence. She is well educated and is pronounced by Sir Lepel Griffin the most remarkable princess in India. She is said to be particularly appreciated of a good joke, but in spite of her love of the \\\\u201clighter things of life,\\\\u201d she is a wise ruler, and under her administration many improvements have been inaugurated, road have been laid out, fine buildings erected, hospitals founded and just laws enacted. The begum, although her subjects are Hindoo, is a devout Mohammedan. Miss Soonderbai Powar is the daughter of converted Hindoos of high caste, who only embraced Christianity late in life. She is very religious herself, and fifteen years of service as a missionary have enabled her to observe the abject misery of many families addicted to the use of opium. She is now engaged in a vigorous crusade against the baneful narcotic, and is sanguine that she will succeed in entirely suppressing the trade in India. \\n', 'om', '20190816_125309']" .

Description: ðŸ—œ gitz - tiny useful git commands, some dangerous ðŸ—œ
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        This is a collection of a dszen git utilities, each of which does one
        useful thing well.
        
        Most of them only exist here, one comes from other git repos, one came from a
        chat on Reddit and I don't know where one of them came from
        
        Nine of them are written in Python 3, the rest use Bash.
        
        There's a summary of what each command does below - for more details use the
        ``-h`` flag like this:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git all -h
        
        How to install
        ==============
        
        If you have ``pip`` installed
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install gitz
        
        Otherwise, download and uncompress
        `this directory
        <https://github.com/rec/gitz/archive/master.tar.gz>`_,
        then put that directory's path into the ``PATH`` environment variable.
        
        Getting help
        ============
        
        Each command has detailed help available by calling it with the -f flag, like
        this: ``git all -h``.
        
        A summary of the commands follows:
        
        
        Safe commands
        =============
        
        Informational commands that don't change your repository
        
        `git-fresh <doc/git-fresh.rst>`_
          Create and push one or more fresh branches
        
        `git-gitz <doc/git-gitz.rst>`_
          Print information about the gitz environment
        
        `git-infer <doc/git-infer.rst>`_
          Commit changes with an auto-generated message
          (from https://github.com/moondewio/git-infer)
        
        `git-ls <doc/git-ls.rst>`_
          List each file with its most recent commit, in subtle color
          (from an unknown source)
        
        .. image:: img/git-ls-screenshot.png
        
        `git-rotate <doc/git-rotate.rst>`_
          Rotate the current branch forward or backward in the list of branches
        
        `git-st <doc/git-st.rst>`_
          Colorful, compact git status
          
          This version written by https://github.com/PlatyPew/, original
          version by https://www.reddit.com/user/ex1c)
        
        .. image:: img/git-st-screenshot.png
        
        `git-stripe <doc/git-stripe.rst>`_
          Push a sequence of commit IDs to the origin repo
        
        Dangerous commands that delete, rename or overwrite branches
        ============================================================
        
        `git-copy <doc/git-copy.rst>`_
          Copy a git branch locally and on all remotes
        
        `git-delete <doc/git-delete.rst>`_
          Delete one or more branches locally and on all remotes
        
        `git-rename <doc/git-rename.rst>`_
          Rename a git branch locally and on all remotes
        
        By default, the branches ``develop`` and ``master`` and the remote ``upstream``
        are not allowed to be copied, renamed, or deleted.
        
        You can disable this by setting the ``--all/-a`` flag, or you can override the
        protected branches or remotes by setting the environment variables
        ``PROTECTED_BRANCHES`` or ``PROTECTED_REMOTES``
        
        Dangerous commands that rewrite history
        =======================================
        
        These commands are not intended for use on a shared or production branch, but
        can significantly speed up rapid development on private branches.
        
        `git-amp <doc/git-amp.rst>`_
          AMend just the last commit message and force-Push, somewhat safely
        
        `git-combine <doc/git-combine.rst>`_
          Combine multiple commits into one
        
        `git-shuffle <doc/git-shuffle.rst>`_
          Reorder and delete commits in the existing branch
        
        `git-snip <doc/git-snip.rst>`_
          Edit one or more commits out of history
        
        `git-split <doc/git-split.rst>`_
          Split a range of commits into many single-file commits
        
        `git-update <doc/git-update.rst>`_
          Update branches from the reference branch
        
        Dangerous commands that are janky
        =================================
        
        ``git-all`` is something I use all the time, but it only works in
        simple cases, and I don't see a good path to making it do complicated
        things in a sane way.
        
        `git-all <doc/git-all.rst>`_
          Perform a command on each of multiple branches or directories

        About
        =====
        
         .. note::
        
            This release of the Python SDK for Oracle NoSQL Database supports only the
            on-premise release, starting with 19.3. It will not work with the Oracle NoSQL
            Database Cloud Service. To work with the Cloud Service use the 5.0.1 release
            or the next release of this SDK that does not have this notice.
        
        This is the Python SDK for Oracle NoSQL Database. Python 2.7+ and 3.5+ are
        supported. The SDK provides interfaces, documentation, and examples to help
        develop Python applications that connect to the Oracle NoSQL
        Database Cloud Service, Oracle NoSQL Database and to the Oracle NoSQL
        Cloud Simulator (which runs on a local machine).
        
        In order to run the Oracle NoSQL Cloud Simulator, a separate download is
        necessary from the Oracle NoSQL OTN download page. Throughout the
        documentation the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service and Cloud Simulator are
        referred to as the "cloud service" while the Oracle NoSQL Database is referred
        to as "on-premise." In the `API reference <https://nosql-python-sdk.readthedocs.
        io/en/latest/api.html>`_ classes and interfaces are noted if they are only
        relevant to a specific environment.
        
        The on-premise configuration requires a running instance of the Oracle NoSQL
        database. In addition a running proxy service is required. See `Oracle NoSQL
        Database Downloads <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/nosql-database-
        server-downloads.html>`_ for downloads, and see `Information about the proxy
        <https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/other-databases/nosql-
        database/19.3/admin&id=NSADM-GUID-C110AF57-8B35-4C48-A82E-2621C6A5ED72>`_ for
        proxy configuration information.

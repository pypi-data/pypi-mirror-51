pytest-twisted is a plugin for pytest, which allows to test code,
which uses the twisted framework. test functions can return Deferred
objects and pytest will wait for their completion with this plugin.

Installation
==================
Install the plugin with::

    pip install pytest-twisted


Using the plugin
==================

The plugin is available after installation and can be disabled using
``-p no:twisted``.

By default ``twisted.internet.default`` is used to install the reactor.
This creates the same reactor that ``import twisted.internet.reactor``
would.  Alternative reactors can be specified using the ``--reactor``
option.  This presently supports ``qt5reactor`` for use with ``pyqt5``
and ``pytest-qt`` as well as ``asyncio``. This `guide`_ describes how to add
support for a new reactor.

The reactor is automatically created prior to the first test but can
be explicitly installed earlier by calling
``pytest_twisted.init_default_reactor()`` or the corresponding function
for the desired alternate reactor.

Beware that in situations such as
a ``conftest.py`` file that the name ``pytest_twisted`` may be
undesirably detected by ``pytest`` as an unknown hook.  One alternative
is to ``import pytest_twisted as pt``.


inlineCallbacks
===============
Using ``twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks`` as a decorator for test
functions, which use fixtures, does not work. Please use
``pytest_twisted.inlineCallbacks`` instead::

  @pytest_twisted.inlineCallbacks
  def test_some_stuff(tmpdir):
      res = yield threads.deferToThread(os.listdir, tmpdir.strpath)
      assert res == []


ensureDeferred
==============
Using ``twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred`` as a decorator for test
functions, which use fixtures, does not work. Please use
``pytest_twisted.ensureDeferred`` instead::

  @pytest_twisted.ensureDeferred
  async def test_some_stuff(tmpdir):
      res = await threads.deferToThread(os.listdir, tmpdir.strpath)
      assert res == []


Waiting for deferreds in fixtures
=================================
``pytest_twisted.blockon`` allows fixtures to wait for deferreds::

  @pytest.fixture
  def val():
      d = defer.Deferred()
      reactor.callLater(1.0, d.callback, 10)
      return pytest_twisted.blockon(d)


The twisted greenlet
====================
Some libraries (e.g. corotwine) need to know the greenlet, which is
running the twisted reactor. It's available from the
``twisted_greenlet`` fixture. The following code can be used to make
corotwine work with pytest-twisted::

  @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
  def set_MAIN(request, twisted_greenlet):
      from corotwine import protocol
      protocol.MAIN = twisted_greenlet


That's (almost) all.

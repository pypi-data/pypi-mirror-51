circuitpython_nrf24l01
========================================

CircuitPython port of the nRF24L01 library from Micropython.
Original work by Damien P. George & Peter Hinch can be found `here <https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/drivers/nrf24l01>`_

The Micropython source has been rewritten to expose all the nRF24L01's features and for compatibilty with the Raspberry Pi and other Circuitpython compatible devices using Adafruit's `busio`, `adafruit_bus_device.spi_device`, and `digitalio`, modules.
Modified by Brendan Doherty, Rhys Thomas

* Author(s): Damien P. George, Peter Hinch, Rhys Thomas, Brendan Doherty

.. important:: The nRF24L01 has 3 key features that are very interdependent of each other. Their priority of dependence is as follows:

    1. `dynamic_payloads` feature allowing either TX/RX nRF24L01 to be able to send/receive payloads with their size written into the payloads' packet. With this disabled, both RX/TX nRF24L01 must use matching `payload_length` attributes.
    2. `auto_ack` feature provides transmission verification by using the RX nRF24L01 to automatically and imediatedly send an acknowledgment (ACK) packet in response to freshly received payloads. `auto_ack` requires `dynamic_payloads` to be enabled.
    3. `ack` feature allows the MCU to append a payload to the ACK packet, thus instant bi-directional communication. A transmitting ACK payload must be loaded into the nRF24L01's TX FIFO buffer (done using `load_ack()`) BEFORE receiving the payload that is to be acknowledged. Once transmitted, the payload is released from the TX FIFO buffer. This feature obviously requires the `auto_ack` feature enabled.

Remeber that the nRF24L01's FIFO (first-in,first-out) buffer has 3 levels. This means that there can be up to 3 payloads waiting to be read (RX) and up to 3 payloads waiting to be transmit (TX).

With the `auto_ack` feature enabled you get:

    * cycle redundancy checking (`crc`) automatically enabled
    * to change amount of automatic re-transmit attempts and the delay time between them. See the `arc` and `ard` attributes.

.. note:: A word on pipes vs addresses vs channels.

    You should think of the data pipes as RF pathways to a specified address. There are only six data pipes on the nRF24L01, thus it can simultaneously "talk" to a maximum of 6 other nRF24L01 radios. When assigning addresses to a data pipe, you can use any 5 byte long address you can think of (as long as the last byte is unique among simultaneously broadcasting addresses), so you're not limited to communicating to the same 6 radios (more on this when we support "Multiciever" mode). Also the radio's channel is not be confused with the radio's pipes. Channel selection is a way of specifying a certain radio frequency (frequency = [2400 + channel] MHz). Channel defaults to 76 (like the arduino library), but options range from 0 to 125 -- that's 2.4 GHz to 2.525 GHz. The channel can be tweaked to find a less occupied frequency amongst (Bluetooth & WiFi) ambient signals.

.. warning:: For successful transmissions, most of the endpoint trasceivers' settings/features must match. These settings/features includes:

    * The RX pipe's address on the receiving nRF24L01 MUST match the TX pipe's address on the transmitting nRF24L01
    * `address_length`
    * `channel`
    * `data_rate`
    * `dynamic_payloads`
    * `payload_length` only when `dynamic_payloads` is disabled
    * `auto_ack`
    * custom `ack` payloads
    * `crc`

    In fact the only attributes that aren't required to match on both endpoint trasceivers would be the pipe number, `pa_level`, `arc`, & `ard` attributes. The ``ask_no_ack`` feature can be used despite the settings/features configuration (see `send()` & `write()` function parameters for more details).

    :param ~busio.SPI spi: The object for the SPI bus that the nRF24L01 is connected to.

        .. tip:: This object is meant to be shared amongst other driver classes (like adafruit_mcp3xxx.mcp3008 for example) that use the same SPI bus. Otherwise, multiple devices on the same SPI bus with different spi objects may produce errors or undesirable behavior.

    :param ~digitalio.DigitalInOut csn: The digital output pin that is connected to the nRF24L01's CSN (Chip Select Not) pin. This is required.
    :param ~digitalio.DigitalInOut ce: The digital output pin that is connected to the nRF24L01's CE (Chip Enable) pin. This is required.
    :param int channel: This is used to specify a certain radio frequency that the nRF24L01 uses. Defaults to 76 and can be changed at any time by using the `channel` attribute.
    :param int payload_length: This is the length (in bytes) of a single payload to be transmitted or received. This is ignored if the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is enabled. Defaults to 32 and must be in range [1,32]. This can be changed at any time by using the `payload_length` attribute.
    :param int address_length: This is the length (in bytes) of the addresses that are assigned to the data pipes for transmitting/receiving. Defaults to 5 and must be in range [3,5]. This can be changed at any time by using the `address_length` attribute.
    :param int ard: This specifies the delay time (in µs) between attempts to automatically re-transmit. This can be changed at any time by using the `ard` attribute. This parameter must be a multiple of 250 in the range [250,4000]. Defualts to 1500 µs.
    :param int arc: This specifies the automatic re-transmit count (maximum number of automatically attempts to re-transmit). This can be changed at any time by using the `arc` attribute. This parameter must be in the range [0,15]. Defaults to 3.
    :param int crc: This parameter controls the CRC setting of transmitted packets. Options are ``0`` (off), ``1`` or ``2`` (byte long CRC enabled). This can be changed at any time by using the `crc` attribute. Defaults to 2
    :param int data_rate: This parameter controls the RF data rate setting of transmissions. Options are ``1`` (Mbps), ``2`` (Mbps), or ``250`` (Kbps). This can be changed at any time by using the `data_rate` attribute. Defaults to 1
    :param int pa_level: This parameter controls the RF power amplifier setting of transmissions. Options are ``0`` (dBm), ``-6`` (dBm), ``-12`` (dBm), or ``-18`` (dBm). This can be changed at any time by using the `pa_level` attribute. Defaults to 0
    :param bool dynamic_payloads: This parameter enables/disables the dynamic payload length feature of the nRF24L01. Defaults to enabled. This can be changed at any time by using the `dynamic_payloads` attribute.
    :param bool auto_ack: This parameter enables/disables the automatic acknowledgment (ACK) feature of the nRF24L01. Defaults to enabled if `dynamic_payloads` is enabled. This can be changed at any time by using the `auto_ack` attribute
    :param bool ask_no_ack: This represents a special flag that has to be thrown to enable a feature specific to individual payloads. Setting this parameter only enables access to this feature; it does not invoke it (see parameters for `send()` or `write()` functions). Enabling/Disabling this does not affect `auto_ack` attribute.
    :param bool ack: This represents a special flag that has to be thrown to enable a feature allowing custom response payloads appended to the ACK packets. Enabling this also requires the `auto_ack` attribute enabled. This can be changed at any time by using the `ack` attribute
    :param bool irq_DR: When "Data is Ready", this configures the interrupt (IRQ) trigger of the nRF24L01's IRQ pin (active low). Defaults to enabled. This can be changed at any time by using the `interrupt_config()` function.
    :param bool irq_DS: When "Data is Sent", this configures the interrupt (IRQ) trigger of the nRF24L01's IRQ pin (active low). Defaults to enabled. This can be changed at any time by using the `interrupt_config()` function.
    :param bool irq_DF: When "max retry attempts are reached" (specified by the `arc` attribute), this configures the interrupt (IRQ) trigger of the nRF24L01's IRQ pin (active low) and represents transmission failure. Defaults to enabled. This can be changed at any time by using the `interrupt_config()` function.

Empty ACK payloads (upon successful transmission) when the `ack` attribute is set `True` are replaced with an error message ``b'NO ACK RETURNED'``.
            * `None` if transmission times out meaning nRF24L01 has malfunctioned. This condition is very rare. The allowed time for transmission is calculated using `table 18 in the nRF24L01 specification sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1123001>`_

            - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled and this bytearray's length is less than the `payload_length` attribute, then this bytearray is padded with zeros until its length is equal to the `payload_length` attribute.
            - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled and this bytearray's length is greater than `payload_length` attribute, then this bytearray's length is truncated to equal the `payload_length` attribute.

        :param bool ask_no_ack: Pass this parameter as `True` to tell the nRF24L01 not to wait for an acknowledgment from the receiving nRF24L01. This parameter directly controls a ``NO_ACK`` flag in the transmission's Packet Control Field (9 bits of information about the payload). Therefore, it takes advantage of an nRF24L01 feature specific to individual payloads, and its value is not saved anywhere. You do not need to specify this for every payload if the `auto_ack` attribute is disabled, however this parameter should work despite the `auto_ack` attribute's setting.

            .. note:: Each transmission is in the form of a packet. This packet contains sections of data around and including the payload. `See Chapter 7.3 in the nRF24L01 Specifications Sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1136318>`_ for more details.


        .. tip:: It is highly recommended that `auto_ack` attribute is enabled when sending multiple payloads. Test results with the `auto_ack` attribute disabled were very poor (much < 50% received). This same advice applies to the ``ask_no_ack`` parameter (leave it as `False` for multiple payloads).

        .. warning::  The nRF24L01 will block usage of the TX FIFO buffer upon failed transmissions. Failed transmission's payloads stay in TX FIFO buffer until the MCU calls `flush_tx()` and `clear_status_flags()`. Therefore, this function will discard failed transmissions' payloads when sending a list or tuple of payloads, so it can continue to process through the list/tuple even if any payload fails to be acknowledged.

        .. note:: We've tried very hard to keep nRF24L01s driven by CircuitPython devices compliant with nRF24L01s driven by the Raspberry Pi. But due to the Raspberry Pi's seemingly slower SPI speeds, we've had to resort to internally deploying `resend()` twice (at most when needed) for payloads that failed during multi-payload processing. This tactic is meant to slow down CircuitPython devices just enough for the Raspberry Pi to catch up. Transmission failures are less possible this way.

            - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled and this bytearray's length is less than the `payload_length` attribute, then this bytearray is padded with zeros until its length is equal to the `payload_length` attribute.
            - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled and this bytearray's length is greater than `payload_length` attribute, then this bytearray's length is truncated to equal the `payload_length` attribute.

        :param bool ask_no_ack: Pass this parameter as `True` to tell the nRF24L01 not to wait for an acknowledgment from the receiving nRF24L01. This parameter directly controls a ``NO_ACK`` flag in the transmission's Packet Control Field (9 bits of information about the payload). Therefore, it takes advantage of an nRF24L01 feature specific to individual payloads, and its value is not saved anywhere. You do not need to specify this for every payload if the `auto_ack` attribute is disabled, however this parameter should work despite the `auto_ack` attribute's setting.

            .. note:: Each transmission is in the form of a packet. This packet contains sections of data around and including the payload. `See Chapter 7.3 in the nRF24L01 Specifications Sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1136318>`_ for more details.

        This function isn't completely non-blocking as we still need to wait just under 5 ms for the CSN pin to settle (allowing a clean SPI transaction).

        .. note:: The nRF24L01 doesn't initiate sending until a mandatory minimum 10 µs pulse on the CE pin is acheived. That pulse is initiated before this function exits. However, we have left that 10 µs wait time to be managed by the MCU in cases of asychronous application, or it is managed by using `send()` instead of this function. If the CE pin remains HIGH for longer than 10 µs, then the nRF24L01 will continue to transmit all payloads found in the TX FIFO buffer.

        .. warning:: A note paraphrased from the `nRF24L01+ Specifications Sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1121422>`_:

            It is important to NEVER to keep the nRF24L01+ in TX mode for more than 4 ms at a time. If the [`auto_ack` and `dynamic_payloads`] features are enabled, nRF24L01+ is never in TX mode longer than 4 ms.

        .. tip:: Use this function at your own risk. Because of the underlying `"Enhanced ShockBurst Protocol" <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1132607>`_, disobeying the 4 ms rule is easily avoided if you enable the `dynamic_payloads` and `auto_ack` attributes. Alternatively, you MUST use interrupt flags/IRQ pin with user defined timer(s) to AVOID breaking the 4 ms rule. If the `nRF24L01+ Specifications Sheet explicitly states this <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1121422>`_, we have to assume radio damage or misbehavior as a result of disobeying the 4 ms rule. See also `table 18 in the nRF24L01 specification sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1123001>`_ for calculating necessary transmission time (these calculations are used in the `send()` function).

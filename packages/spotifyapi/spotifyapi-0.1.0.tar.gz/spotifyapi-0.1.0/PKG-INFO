        *spotifyapi* is a modern Python wrapper to interact with the Spotify web API. *spotifyapi* attempts to stay as close as possible to
        the original API calls while implementing more Pythonic features.
        
        ## Installation
        
        *spotifyapi* supports Python 3.6 and higher and can be installed through Pip.
        
        ```pip install spotifyapi```
        
        ## Example
        
        The easiest way to use *spotifyapi* is using the SpotifyEndpoint which implements all methods of the package. However, it
        is still possible to use the individual endpoints such as AlbumEndpoint, PlayerEndpoint, etc.
        
        ```python
        from spotifyapi import SpotifyEndpoint
        
        spotify = SpotifyEndpoint(token)
        
        # Get the currently playing track
        playing = spotify.get_currently_playing().item
        
        # Get the track's features using Spotify's machine learning
        features = spotify.get_audio_features(playing)
        
        # Time to party!
        if features.danceability > 0.75:
            spotify.volume(100)
        ```

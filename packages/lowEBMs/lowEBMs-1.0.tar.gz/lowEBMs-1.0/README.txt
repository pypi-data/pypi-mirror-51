This python package is an implementation of low-dimensional energy balance models.

It shall serves as a framework to compile and simulate energy balance models from a collection of parameterizations which describe the energy transport of reduced/simplified earth system.

Models (Parameterizations) implemented are:
-0D energy balance models
-1D energy balance models

The range of applications and features is constantly extended. They focus on:
-Exploration and quantification of parameterizations describing the climate system
-Exploration and quantification of radiative climate forcings 
-Fast and accessible tools to analyze climate system simulations
-Tools for the optimization of parameterizations 

The most implementations are based on the work of former developers of climate models which are tried to be gathered and combined within this package. The central approaches to formulate energy balance models included in this package are based on the publications from Sellers (1969) and Budyko (1968).

A detailed description of the implementations, installation, usage, future plans and further references can be found in the packages documentation.

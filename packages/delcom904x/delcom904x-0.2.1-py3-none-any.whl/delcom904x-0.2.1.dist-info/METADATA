delcom904x
==========
delcom904x is a python class to control the [Delcom Products 904x series multi-color
visual signal indicators](http://www.delcomproducts.com/products_USBLMP.asp). These are
USB HID devices that are easily programmable on most platforms.

It has been tested with the [904005-SB](http://www.delcomproducts.com/productdetails.asp?productnum=904005-SB)
but should work with any of the other models without any issues. Currently if you have a
green, red and yellow indicator, substitute `--blue` for yellow (they're wired the same).

Requirements
============

[cython-hidapi](https://github.com/trezor/cython-hidapi) - Cross platform library to control USB HID devices.

[hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi) - Python wrapper for the hidapi

Installation
============

        $ pip install delcom904x
        $ ./control_delcom904x.py --green --red --flash --cycle


Example Usage
=============

```python
import delcom904x
light = delcom904x.DelcomMultiColorIndicator()
light.set_color(delcom904x.red, flashing = true)
```

udev Notes
================

On Linux machines, the default udev rulesets may set the permissions on the device to only
be accessible to the root user. Add the following rule to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and
re-plugin the indicator to allow all users to access the device (optionally, consider
changing `MODE="0666"` to `GROUP="dialout"` to allow only the dialout group access).

        SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fc5", ATTRS{idProduct}=="b080", MODE="0666"

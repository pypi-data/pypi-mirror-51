===========
Intake-esm
===========

`Intake-esm` provides an `intake`_ plugin for creating ``file-based Intake catalogs``
for climate data from project efforts such as the `Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)`_
and the `Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble Project`_.
These projects produce a huge of amount climate data persisted on tape, disk storage components
across multiple (in the order of ~ 300,000) netCDF files. Finding, investigating, loading these files into data array containers
such as `xarray` can be a daunting task due to the large number of files a user may be interested in.
``Intake-esm`` addresses this issue in three steps:

- `Datasets Collection Curation`_ in form of YAML files. These YAML files provide information about data locations, access     pattern,  directory structure, etc. ``intake-esm`` uses these YAML files in conjunction with file name templates
  to construct a local database. Each row in this database consists of a set of metadata such as ``experiment``,
  ``modeling realm``, ``frequency`` corresponding to data contained in one netCDF file.

  .. code-block:: python

        >>> import intake
        >>> col = intake.open_esm_metadatastore(collection_name="GLADE-CMIP5")


- Search and Discovery: once the database is built, ``intake-esm`` can be used for searching and discovering
  of climate datasets by eliminating the need for the user to know specific locations (file path) of
  their data set of interest:

  .. code-block:: python

        >>> cat = col.search(variable=['hfls'], frequency='mon',
        ...          modeling_realm='atmos',
        ...          institute=['CCCma', 'CNRM-CERFACS'])

- Access: when the user is satisfied with the results of their query, they can ask ``intake-esm``
  to load the actual netCDF files into xarray datasets:

  .. code-block:: python

        >>> dsets = cat.to_xarray(decode_times=True, chunks={'time': 50})


Intake-esm supports data holdings from the following projects:

- `CMIP`_: Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (phase 5 and phase 6)
- `CESM`_: Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (LENS), and Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE)
- `MPI-GE`_: The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE)
- `GMET`_: The Gridded Meteorological Ensemble Tool data
- `ERA5`_: ECWMF ERA5 Reanalysis dataset stored on NCAR's GLADE in ``/glade/collections/rda/data/ds630.0``
- `NA-CORDEX`_: The North American CORDEX program dataset residing on NCAR's GLADE in ``/glade/collections/cdg/data/cordex/data/``
- `CESM-LENS-AWS`_: Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM LENS) data holdings publicly available on Amazon S3 (us-west-2 region)

"""
Generate text on the large 774M model using your own prompt and standard parameters.
temperature = 1, nsamples = 2, length = 100
This only takes couple seconds per query.
We're training additional models for your use in the near future, such as 774M finetuned on Chinese, Spanish, Wikipedia...
We're also releasing finetuning APIs in September 2019.
Stay tuned :)

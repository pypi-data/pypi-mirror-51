pDNS Module Repository
======================

This project is an implementation of a passive DNS reqplication database (pDNS)
using SQLAlchemy, Alembic and PostgreSQL.

It is geared towards small-ish installations; most likely it is not capable of
handling an ISP's DNS data volume for example.

The source code can be found in `woohoo pDNS' home on Gitlab`_ (link mainly for
people reading this on PyPI).

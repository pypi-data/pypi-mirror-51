		<h1>Profile Picture Importer</h1>
		<p>The profile editor allows for the display of a picture along the profile. The importer allows for a simple set of coordinates to be assigned to the picture.</p>
		<p>If a .npz file is connected to this module (imported through the import 3D model tool) then appropriate default values for the picture are filled in.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Profile Direction - The profile can be defined as being west to east or south to north.</li>
			<li>West/South Coordinate - This is the coordinate assigned to the left side of the image.</li>
			<li>East/North Coordinate - This is the coordinate assigned to the right side of the image.</li>
			<li>Maximum Altitude - this is the altitude at the top of the image.</li>
			<li>Depth - This is the depth of the image.</li>
		</ul>

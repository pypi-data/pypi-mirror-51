        This is an active fork of
        `baiji-serialization <https://github.com/bodylabs/baiji-serialization>`__,
        a library for reading and writing common file formats to Amazon S3 and
        local files.
        
        The fork’s goals are modest:
        
        -  Keep the library working in current versions of Python and other
           tools.
        -  Make bug fixes.
        -  Provide API stability and backward compatibility with the upstream
           version.
        -  Respond to community contributions.
        
        It’s used by related forks such as
        `lace <https://github.com/metabolize/lace>`__.

        -  Supports Python 2.7 and uses boto2
        -  Supports OS X, Linux, and Windows
        -  Tested and production-hardened

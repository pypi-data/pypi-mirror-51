### enaml-native iOS

Write iOS apps in python using native widgets!  

> Note: This only supports iOS 8+ since it requires dylibs for python extensions! 

At the moment the build process is not fully automated and only a small number of widgets are implemented 
(basic controls, and flexbox) hence this is not nearly ready enough for use, but the concept has been
proven to work.

Will try to get a youtube video up soon.

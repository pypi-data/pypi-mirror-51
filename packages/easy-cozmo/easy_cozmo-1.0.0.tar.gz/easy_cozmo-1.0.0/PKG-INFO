        easy_cozmo provides a bunch of python wrappers for Anki Cozmo's SDK. You might
        find it most useful for educational tasks involving students with little CS
        background. This library was created for a series of workshops for high shool
        students in Qatar. The code has been used by over 1,000 students over one year.
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
            """
            Makes cozmo saying "hello world"
            """
        
            from easy_cozmo import *
        
            def cozmo_program():
            	say("Hello world")
        
            run_program_with_viewer(cozmo_program)

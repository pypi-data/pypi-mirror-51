# vault_printer ![pylint 10.00][pylint-badge] [![MIT License][license-badge]](LICENSE.md) [![PyPI version][pypi-badge]][pypi-project]
vault_printer is a little program to extract a whole kv_store of a [Vault Server][vaultproject] to stdout in markdown.
This could be used to print it out and store it in a physical safe somewhere. Or at least that's the purpose for which I wrote it.

## Install

Get a stable version from [PyPi][pypi]

`pip install vault_printer`

or via git

`pip install git+https://github.com/DerMolly/vault_printer`

## Usage

E.g extract kv_store `test` from `vault.example.com` and login via ldap:

`vault_printer --ldap vault.example.com test >> passwords.md `

### Help

```

usage: vault_printer [-h] [-v] [--ldap | --token] [--username USERNAME]
                     [--password PASSWORD] [--tokenLogin TOKENLOGIN]
                     [url] kv_store

get all secrets from a vaultservers kv_store for printing

positional arguments:
  url                   the url of the vault server
  kv_store              the kv store to export from

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity
  --ldap                login via ldap
  --token               login via token
  --username USERNAME, -u USERNAME
                        the username with which to login, if omitted you'll be
                        asked
  --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                        the password to login, if omitted you'll be asked
  --tokenLogin TOKENLOGIN, -t TOKENLOGIN
                        the token to login, if omitted you'll be asked
```


### Login

Currently the only supported login methods are:

- Token
- LDAP

Maybe I will add some more in the future. If you need another Login Method feel free to open a [issue][tracker] or even a PR.

### Environment Variables

This program also uses these environment variables if set

`$VAULT_ADDR`  : the url of the vault server  
`$VAULT_TOKEN` : the token to authenticate with the `--token` login method

This library defines abstract interfaces for loading financial market data. Where such data is provided by a brokerage (as opposed to a general-purpose API), `bankroll-marketdata` also extends the abstractions of [bankroll-broker](https://github.com/bankroll-py/bankroll-broker).

This library is part of the [bankroll](https://github.com/bankroll-py) project.

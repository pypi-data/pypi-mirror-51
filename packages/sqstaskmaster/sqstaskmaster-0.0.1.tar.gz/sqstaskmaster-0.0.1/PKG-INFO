Description: SQS Task Master for Python

        SQS Task Master is one of many packages for distributed asynchronous task execution in python.
        This package is different in that it is designed to work with uncooperative tasks.
        It is designed for CPU intensive tasks which will not work in a python cooperative threading model.
        It allows for tasks that may take upto 12 hours (the limit for SQS).
        It also provides for applying a hard timeout for a task, less than 12 hours.
        The implementation relies on using Singals to achieve these behaviors.
        Retries and failures are handled using SQS infrastructure.
        It is designed to work with standard SQS queues which guarantee at least once delivery.

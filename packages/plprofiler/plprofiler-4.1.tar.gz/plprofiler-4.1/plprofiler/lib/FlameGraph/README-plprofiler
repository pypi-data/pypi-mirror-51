This directory is a stripped down to the bare minimum version
of Brendan D. Gregg's famous FlameGraph script collection.

The plprofiler produces the input format of flamegraph.pl. So
nothing else from the project is really needed and therfore
there is no need to include it in this embedded lib directory.

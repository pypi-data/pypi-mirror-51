Description: ==================================================================
        ``cedar`` - Create Earth engine Data cubes of Analytical Readiness
        ==================================================================
        
        cedar is a library and application to help download and preprocess
        satellite data to be "analysis ready data" (ARD) "data cube" as quickly as
        possible. cedar has been designed primarily to preprocess Landsat data, and can
        help acquire data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE). It is based on tools
        within the Python ecosystem for geospatial data processing (rasterio_), saving
        and working with N-dimensional data (netCDF4_ and xarray_), and parallelization
        (dask_ and distributed_).

        v0.0.4
        ======
        
        * **Fixed** bug in ``cedar clean`` command
        * The ``cedar convert`` program will now copy "pre-ARD" image metadata JSON
          files to the destination directory alongside the "pre-ARD" images (GeoTIFFs
          converted to NetCDF files). To prevent this behavior, pass
          ``--skip-metadata`` to the program.
        * Changes were made in where exceptions are handled for the case where a user
          requests a "pre-ARD" image that returns 0 search results (e.g., wrong time
          period for sensor, bad historic coverage, etc). By default, ``Order.add``
          will not raise an ``EmptyCollectionError`` when you try to add a "pre-ARD"
          image that had 0 image results. You can force an error to be raised by
          setting ``error_if_empty=True`` in either ``Order.add`` or
          ``Tracker.submit``.
        
        
        v0.0.3
        ======
        
        
        * **BREAKING CHANGE** - Require image collection filters to be specified in
          the configuration file according to the image collection. This change
          has been made to prepare for using image collections that do not
          have the same filters (e.g., more than just ``LANDSAT/*/C01/T1_SR`` data)
        * Add a check to make sure that ``Order.name_template`` creates unique names
          for pre-ARD before continuing. If there are duplicate names, raises ValueError
        * Fix warning when calculating mean/std runtime of tasks that haven't been
          updated (``RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice``...)
        * Provide better info in ``cedar status list`` when nothing is tracked because
          the tracking folder doesn't exist
        * Fix bug when ordering but not using filters that resulted in 0 images being
          found
        * Validate image collection names using ``click`` argument callback
          in ``cedar submit`` CLI
        * Improve error propagation inside ``cedar.ordering.Order`` and
          ``cedar.tracker.Tracker``. ``Order.add`` no longer catches and swallows
          ``EmptyCollectionError``, which now is handled in ``Tracker.submit``
        
        
        v0.0.2
        ======
        
        * Fix bug in jsonschema validation by allowing tuples & lists to count
          as 'array'
        * Added ``cedar status cancel`` command to cancel orders
        * Refactor internals to use ``TrackingMetadata`` model
        
        v0.0.1.post1
        ============
        
        * Fix packaging issue (missing package data)
        
        
        v0.0.1.post0
        ============
        
        * Fix packaging issue
        
        
        v0.0.1

def retrieve_equities(test_mode=False):
    """
    This function retrieves all the available `spanish equities` indexed on Investing.com, so to
    retrieve data from them which will be used later for inner functions for data retrieval.
    All the equities available can be found at: https://es.investing.com/equities/spain. Additionally,
    when equities are retrieved all the meta-information is both returned as a :obj:`pandas.DataFrame`
    and stored on a CSV file on a package folder containing all the available resources.
    Note that maybe some of the information contained in the resulting :obj:`pandas.DataFrame` is useless as it is
    just used for inner function purposes.

    Args:
        test_mode (:obj:`bool`):
            variable to avoid time waste on travis-ci since it just needs to test the basics in order to determine code
            coverage.

    Returns:
        :obj:`pandas.DataFrame` - equities:
            The resulting :obj:`pandas.DataFrame` contains all the spanish equities meta-information if found, if not, an
            empty :obj:`pandas.DataFrame` will be returned and no CSV file will be stored.

            In the case that the retrieval process of spanish equities was successfully completed, the resulting
            :obj:`pandas.DataFrame` will look like::

                name | full name | tag | isin | id
                -----|-----------|-----|------|----
                xxxx | xxxxxxxxx | xxx | xxxx | xx

    Raises:
        ValueError: if any of the introduced arguments is not valid.
        ConnectionError: if GET requests does not return 200 status code.
        IndexError: if equities information was unavailable or not found.

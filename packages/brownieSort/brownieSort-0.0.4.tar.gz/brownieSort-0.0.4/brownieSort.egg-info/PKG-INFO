Description: #brownieSort
        A programme for sorting __brownies__ into groups (tents)
        of equal size according to friendships. Brownies and
        friendship choices are imported from a text file.
        An algorithm is run to find the optimal (or near best)
        groupings of brownies. The best camp can be printed to the screen
        as a list of tents, their occupants, and the associated
        happiness scores.
        
        *in the UK, a brownie is a junior girl-guide (or junior girl-scout)*

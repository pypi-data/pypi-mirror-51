Description: # DOBGCLI
        Command line tool for easier management of your Digital Ocean droplets.
        
        ## Getting started
        ### Prerequisities
        You will need to install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Pip3 should be included in Python3 installation. Otherwise, install [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) manually.
        
        ### Installing
        Use `pip3 install dobg` to install dobgcli globally or `pip install dobg` inside your virtual environment. Make sure, though, that virtual environment is using Python3.
        
        ### Start using dobgcli
        This command will display general help message where you can see all subcommands and what they're used for:
        ```
        dobg [-h]
        ```
        You will need to set up config file with your Digital Ocean token:
        ```
        dobg settoken <your_token>
        ```
        After that, you will be able to use all other subcommands.

Introduction to aiokatcp
========================

aiokatcp is an implementation of the `katcp`_ protocol based around the Python
asyncio system module. It requires Python 3.5 or later, as it makes extensive
uses of coroutines and type annotations. It is loosely inspired by the `Python
2 bindings`_, but has a much narrower scope.

The current implementation only supports katcp version 5, and does not support
a number of features that are marked deprecated in version 5. The client is
also only able to communicate with a version 5 server.

Description: 
        
        Read the docs to `find out what constitutes a OneGov Cloud application <http://onegov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/onegov_cloud_modules.html>`_.
        
        The resulting onegov.applications package in PyPI can be used to install all
        OneGov applications in one sweep, with the guarantee that all of them were
        tested with the same set of dependencies.
        
        That is the meta-package serves as a known good set of dependencies. As such
        it allows for applications to be run in the same process using
        `onegov.server <http://github.com/onegov/onegov.server>`_.
        
        Unlike other OneGov applications this package does not use Semantic Versioning,
        instead opting for a simple year + build number scheme. For example::
        
          - 2017.1
          - 2017.2
          - 2017.14
          - 2018.1
        
        Before this package is released all contained applications are tested using
        their respective unit/integration tests. For this the latest release of
        each application is acquired. Therefore each application should be released
        separately first, before being included in onegov.applications.
        
        Create a New Release
        --------------------
        
        To create a new release for onegov.applications simply run the following
        commands in the repository's folder::
        
          pip install punch.py
          punch --action build
        
          git push
          git push --tags
        
        Add a New Application
        ---------------------
        
        To add a new application edit the ``application.json`` file in the
        ``onegov/applications`` folder. It will then automatically be included in
        the build.
        
        In addition, each application has to be added to the .travis.yml build matrix.
        
        Run the Tests
        -------------
        
        Install tox and run it::
        
            pip install tox
            tox
        
        Limit the tests to a specific python version::
        
            tox -e py27
        
        Conventions
        -----------
        
        Onegov Applications follows PEP8 as close as possible. To test for it run::
        
            tox -e pep8

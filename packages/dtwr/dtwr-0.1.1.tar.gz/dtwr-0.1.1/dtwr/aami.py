"""ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms, 3a and 3b


ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms 3a and 3b, as obtained from the PhysioBank
database.


**Details**

The following text is reproduced (abridged) from PhysioBank, page
https://www_physionet_org/content/aami-ec13/1_0_0/. Other recordings
belong to the dataset and can be obtained from the same page.

The files in this set can be used for testing a variety of devices that
monitor the electrocardiogram. The recordings include both synthetic and
real waveforms. For details on these test waveforms and how to use them,
please refer to section 5_1_2_1, paragraphs (e) and (g) in the reference
below. Each recording contains one ECG signal sampled at 720 Hz with
12-bit resolution.



Parameters
----------




Returns
-------

(None)


Notes
-----

Timestamps in the datasets have been re-created at the indicated
frequency of 720 Hz, whereas the original timestamps in ms (at least in
text format) only had three decimal digitsâ€™ precision, and were
therefore affected by substantial jittering.

Metadata-Version: 1.1
Name: dtwr
Version: 0.4.1
Summary: (Obsolete package: please use dtw-python). A comprehensive implementation of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithms in R. DTW computes the optimal (least cumulative distance) alignment between points of two time series. Common DTW variants covered include local (slope) and global (window) constraints, subsequence matches, arbitrary distance definitions, normalizations, minimum variance matching, and so on. Provides cumulative distances, alignments, specialized plot styles, etc.

        ==================
        
        
        Package superseded
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This package has been superseded. The `dtw-python <https://pypi.org/project/dtw-python>`__ package should used instead.
        
        
        
        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        Comprehensive implementation of Dynamic Time Warping algorithms.
        Supports arbitrary local (eg symmetric, asymmetric, slope-limited) and
        global (windowing) constraints, fast native code, several plot styles,
        and more.
        
        This package provides
        the most complete, freely-available (GPL) implementation of Dynamic Time
        Warping-type (DTW) algorithms up to date. It is a faithful Python equivalent
        of `R's DTW package <http://dtw.r-forge.r-project.org/>`__.
        
        
        The package is described in a `companion
        paper <http://www.jstatsoft.org/v31/i07/>`__, including detailed
        instructions and extensive background on things like multivariate
        matching, open-end variants for real-time use, interplay between
        recursion types and length normalization, history, etc.

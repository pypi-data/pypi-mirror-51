  releasenotes/notes/Add-called_once-property-a69546448cbd5542.yaml:
    features:
    - A called_once property was added to the adapter and the mocker. This gives us
      an easy way to emulate mock's assert_called_once.
    prelude: 'Add a called_once property to the mockers.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/Allow-pickling-response-fe751b0a760a5001.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Remove weakref objects from the request/response that will allow the objects
      to be pickled with the regular python mechanisms.
  releasenotes/notes/Bump-minimum-requests-2.3-70fd287f6ea1a12e.yaml:
    critical:
    - 'The minimum version of requests has been increase to 2.3. This simply

      ensures that all documented features of requests-mock are actually

      available. This version of requests is still quite old and if this is an

      issue you should either pin requests-mock to <1.6 or preferably update

      requests.

      '
    prelude: 'Increase the minimum required requests version to 2.3

      '
  releasenotes/notes/additional-matcher-5c5cd466a6d70080.yaml:
    features:
    - Allow specifying an `additional_matcher` to the mocker that will call a function
      to allow a user to add their own custom request matching logic.
  releasenotes/notes/case-insensitive-matching-a3143221359bbf2d.yaml:
    features:
    - You can pass case_sensitive=True to an adapter or set `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive
      = True` globally to enable case sensitive matching.
    fixes:
    - Reported in bug \#1584008 all request matching is done in a case insensitive
      way, as a byproduct of this request history is handled in a case insensitive
      way. This can now be controlled by setting case_sensitive to True when creating
      an adapter or globally.
    prelude: 'It is now possible to make URL matching and request history not lowercase
      the provided URLs.

      '
    upgrade:
    - It is recommended you add `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive = True` to your
      base test file to globally turn on case sensitive matching as this will become
      the default in a 2.X release.
  releasenotes/notes/fix-pytest-version-discovery-43f27e7e162ed055.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Fixed a bug relating to how the pytest version was being discovered that meant
      new versions of pytest were being treated as old versions and would receive
      bad configuration.
  releasenotes/notes/fixture-extras-699a5b5fb5bd6aab.yaml:
    features: Added 'fixture' to pip extras so you can install the fixture requirements
      with `pip install requests-mock[fixture]`
    prelude: 'Installing the requirements for the ''fixture'' contrib package can
      now be done via pip with `pip install requests-mock[fixture]`

      '
  releasenotes/notes/match-empty-query-string-e6d6976fe002da0b.yaml:
    features:
    - You can now match on the empty query string value like `/path?a`.
  releasenotes/notes/pin-requests-version-e0f090aa31dc86c3.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'Pins version of requests to <3 to prepare for new release of requests in future.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/py.test-2-4e7735793288ea2d.yaml:
    fixes:
    - The py.test plugin was broken when using py.test < 3.0. The version of py.test
      that ships in EPEL is only 2.7 so we need to make sure we support at least that
      version.
    prelude: 'Fix py.test plugin with py.test < 3.0

      '
  releasenotes/notes/pytest-7e35da8c5f2cd428.yaml:
    features:
    - Added pytest fixture for native integration into pytest projects.
  releasenotes/notes/repo-move-15e956e1d54c048b.yaml:
    other:
    - 'In this release the main repository was moved off of OpenStack provided

      infrastructure and onto github at

      https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock. OpenStack has been a great

      home for the project however requests-mock is a general python project with

      no specific relationship to OpenStack and the unfamiliar infrastructure was

      limiting contributes from the wider community.

      '
    prelude: 'The primary repository is now at https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock

      '
  releasenotes/notes/request-history-stream-f1d75b33adcd7e97.yaml:
    features:
    - The stream parameter is recorded when the request is sent and available in request
      history in the same was as parameters like verify or timeout.
  releasenotes/notes/user-response-encoding-b2eea39404140164.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'If you specified a charset in the Content-Type of a response it would be

      ignored and overriden with either ''utf-8'' or None depending on the type of

      response content passed in. If you pass this value we should honour it and

      perform the encoding correctly.

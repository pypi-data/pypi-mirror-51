    """GoldenGate assembly.

    Takes the design of a protocol and finds combinations of
    SeqRecords that will circularize into valid new plasmids.

    This Protocol is derived from NEB's guide:
    https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/10/02/golden-gate-assembly-protocol-for-using-neb-golden-gate-assembly-mix-e1601

    Full responsibilities include

        1. subselecting the input designs that will form valid plasmids
            after digestion with BsaI and BpiI
        2. adding NEB Golden Gate Assembly Mix to the valid designs as Contents for a Container
        3. computing the final plasmid (SeqRecord) after ligation of digested fragments
        4. memoize the sorted enzyme + ids -> SeqRecord from step #3, pass as a
            "mutate" method for the step after ThermoCycle()
        5. add steps to carry out the rest of the assembly (heat shock, incubate, etc)

    Keyword Args:
        include: include only plasmids with a feature matching something
            in the include list use in backbone selection (default: {None})
        mix: the assembly mix to use when mixing the GoldenGate assemblies
        min_count: the minimum number of SeqRecords in an assembly for it to
            be considered valid. smaller assemblies are ignored

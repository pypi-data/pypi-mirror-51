Description: 
        **spm1d** is a Python package for <b>one-dimensional Statistical Parametric Mapping<b>.
        spm1d uses <b>Random Field Theory</b> expectations regarding the behavior of smooth,
        one-dimensional Gaussian fields to make statistical inferences regarding a set of
        one-dimensional measurements.

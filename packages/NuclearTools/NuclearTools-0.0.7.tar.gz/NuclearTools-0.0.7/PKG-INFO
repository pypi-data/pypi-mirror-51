Description: 
        # NuclearTools
        An assortment of handy nuclear engineering tools
        
        This package provides various simple Nuclear functions to quickly obtain data in a python environment such
        as giving molecular weight of compound such as UO2, giving atomic weights and binding energy per nucleon.
        
        Possibly most important is the ability to pull ENDF cross section data directly from online.
        
        This package is currently in the first stages of development but plans for a quick expansion to include many
        other helpful tools.
        
        Recently added abilities include core thermal distributons, critical heat flux calculations, void fractions, 
        and much more. 
        
        Various functions rely on numpy, pint, and many other well known python packages.  
        
        Please feel free to send in functions or classes that would be useful to class work or research to have
        them added to the package.
        
        # Setup
        
        It is highly recommended to install Anaconda for the best results in compatability and in setup.
        
        To setup simply execute:
        >> pip install NuclearTools
        
        Then you should be good to go!

Regular celestial images and cubes
**********************************

One of the most common types of data to reproject are celestial images or
n-dimensional data (such as spectral cubes) where two of the axes are
celestial. There are several existing algorithms that can be used to
reproject such data:

* **Interpolation** (such as nearest-neighbor, bilinear, biquadratic
  interpolation and so on). This is the fastest algorithm and is suited to
  common use cases, but it is important to note that it is not flux
  conserving, and will not return optimal results if the input and output
  pixel sizes are very different.

* **Drizzling**, which consists of determining the exact overlap fraction of
  pixels, and optionally allows pixels to be rescaled before reprojection.
  A description of the algorithm can be found in
  `Fruchter and Hook (2002) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/338393>`__. This
  method is more accurate than interpolation but is only suitable for images
  where the field of view is small so that pixels are well approximated by
  rectangles in world coordinates. This is slower but more accurate than
  interpolation for small fields of view.

* Computing the **exact overlap** of pixels on the sky by treating them as
  **four-sided spherical polygons** on the sky and computing spherical polygon
  intersection. This is essentially an exact form of drizzling, and should be
  appropriate for any field of view. However, this comes at a significant
  performance cost. This is the algorithm used by the `Montage
  <http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html>`_ package, and we have
  implemented it here using the same core algorithm.

Currently, this package implements interpolation and spherical polygon
intersection.

.. note:: The reprojection/resampling is always done assuming that the image is in
          **surface brightness units**. For example, if you have an image
          with a constant value of 1, reprojecting the image to an image with
          twice as high resolution will result in an image where all pixels
          are all 1. This limitation is due to the interpolation algorithms
          (the fact that interpolation can be used implicitly assumes that
          the pixel values can be interpolated which is only the case with
          surface brightness units). If you have an image in flux units,
          first convert it to surface brightness, then use the functions
          described below. In future, we will provide a convenience function
          to return the area of all the pixels to make it easier.

Interpolation
=============

Reprojection using interpolation can be done using the high-level
:func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp

This function takes two main arguments. The first argument is the image to
reproject, together with WCS information about the image. This can be either:

* The name of a FITS file
* An :class:`~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object
* An image HDU object such as a :class:`~astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`,
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU`, or
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.CompImageHDU` instance
* A tuple where the first element is a :class:`~numpy.ndarray` and the
  second element is either a :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header` object

In the case of a FITS file or an :class:`~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object, if
there is more than one Header-Data Unit (HDU), the ``hdu_in`` argument is
also required and should be set to the ID or the name of the HDU to use.

The second argument is the WCS information for the output image, which should
be specified either as a :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
:class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header` instance. If this is specified as a
:class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` instance, the ``shape_out`` argument to
:func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` should also be specified, and be
given the shape of the output image using the Numpy ``(ny, nx)`` convention
(this is because :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS`, unlike
:class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header`, does not contain information about image
size).

As an example, we start off by opening a FITS file using Astropy::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> hdu = fits.open('http://data.astropy.org/galactic_center/gc_msx_e.fits')[0]    # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    Downloading http://data.astropy.org/galactic_center/gc_msx_e.fits [Done]

The image is currently using a Plate CarÃ©e projection::

    >>> hdu.header['CTYPE1']   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    'GLON-CAR'

We can create a new header using a Gnomonic projection::

    >>> new_header = hdu.header.copy()   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> new_header['CTYPE1'] = 'GLON-TAN'   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> new_header['CTYPE2'] = 'GLAT-TAN'   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

And finally we can call the :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function to reproject
the image::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp
    >>> new_image, footprint = reproject_interp(hdu, new_header)   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function returns two arrays -
the first is the reprojected input image, and the second is a 'footprint'
array which shows the fraction of overlap of the input image on the output
image grid. This footprint is 0 for output pixels that fall outside the input
image, 1 for output pixels that fall inside the input image. For more
information about footprint arrays, see the :doc:`footprints` section.

We can then easily write out the reprojected image to a new FITS file::

    >>> fits.writeto('reprojected_image.fits', new_image, new_header)   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

The order of the interpolation can be controlled by setting the ``order=``
argument to either an integer or a string giving the order of the
interpolation. Supported strings include:

* ``'nearest-neighbor'``: zeroth order interpolation
* ``'bilinear'``: fisst order interpolation
* ``'biquadratic'``: second order interpolation
* ``'bicubic'``: third order interpolation

Very Large Cubes
----------------
If you have a very large cube to reproject, i.e., any normal IFU or radio spectral cube with many
individual spectral channels - you may not be able to hold two copies of the
cube in memory.  In this case, you can specify an output memory mapped array to
store the data.

You can use the following approach for large data, but only with the interpolation reprojection methods.

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> outhdr = fits.Header.fromtextfile('cube_header_gal.hdr')
    >>> shape = (outhdr['NAXIS3'], outhdr['NAXIS2'], outhdr['NAXIS1'])
    >>> outarray = np.memmap(filename='output.np', mode='w+', shape=shape, dtype='float32')
    >>> hdu = fits.open('cube_file.fits')
    >>> rslt = reproject.reproject_interp(hdu, outhdr, output_array=outarray,
    ...                                   return_footprint=False,
    ...                                   independent_celestial_slices=True)
    >>> newhdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(data=outarray, header=outhdr)
    >>> newhdu.writeto('new_cube_file.fits')

Or if you're dealing with FITS files, you can skip the numpy memmap step and use `FITS large file creation
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/io/skip_create-large-fits.html>`_.

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> outhdr = fits.Header.fromtextfile('cube_header_gal.hdr')
    >>> outhdr.tofile('new_cube.fits')
    >>> shape = tuple(outhdr['NAXIS{0}'.format(ii)] for ii in range(1, outhdr['NAXIS']+1))
    >>> with open('new_cube.fits', 'rb+') as fobj:
    >>>     fobj.seek(len(outhdr.tostring()) + (np.product(shape) * np.abs(outhdr['BITPIX']//8)) - 1)
    >>>     fobj.write(b'\0')
    >>> outhdu = fits.open('new_cube.fits', mode='update')
    >>> rslt = reproject.reproject_interp(hdu, outhdr, output_array=outhdu[0].data,
    ...                                   return_footprint=False,
    ...                                   independent_celestial_slices=True)
    >>> outhdu.flush()

Drizzling
=========

Support for the drizzle algorithm will be implemented in future versions.

Spherical Polygon Intersection
==============================

Exact reprojection using the spherical polygon intersection can be done using
the high-level :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` function::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_exact

The two first arguments, the input data and the output projection, should be
specified as for the :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function
described in `Interpolation`_. In addition, an optional ``parallel=`` option
can be used to control whether to parallelize the reprojection, and if so how
many cores to use (see :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` for more
details). For this algorithm, the footprint array returned gives the exact
fractional overlap of new pixels with the original image (see
:doc:`footprints` for more details).

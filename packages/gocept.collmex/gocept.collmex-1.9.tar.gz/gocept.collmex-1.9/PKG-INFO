        Introduction
        ============
        
        Collmex is an online ERP system for (small) companies with a focus on simple
        accounting. <http://www.collmex.de> (Note: Collmex is Germany-based but seems
        to support English. You're bound to stumble over German strings, though.)
        
        This package aims to provide pythonic bindings to program against Collmex'
        API. It includes transaction management for integration with the ZODB or other
        databases that can integrate with the `transaction` package.
        
        
        Credentials
        ===========
        
        To initialize a connection to the collmex server, login-credentials are required. These can be given explicitely when the ``gocept.collmex.collmex.Collmex`` object is created or via an ini file named ``collmex.ini``.
        The ini file must live in the project directory or any of it's parent directories, e.g. it is possible to place ``collmex.ini`` in your home directory to use those credentials for all of your projects.
        The ini file must contain the section ``[credentials]`` for production and ``[test-credentials]`` for testing purposes.
        Each section must have the following options: ``customer_id``, ``company_id``, ``username`` and ``password``.
        The file ``collmex.ini-example`` can be used as a template.
        
        Example::
        
            [credentials]
            customer_id = 42555
            company_id = 1
            username = realuser
            password = realpassword
        
            [test-credentials]
            customer_id = 41222
            company_id = 1
            username = testuser
            password = testpassword
        
        
        
        Collmex API
        ===========
        
        Collmex provides a POST- and CSV-based API, which is encapsulated into a
        utility that provides methods for the various CSV record types.  API
        documentation is available at
        http://www.collmex.de/cgi-bin/cgi.exe?1005,1,help,api.
        
        
        Compatibility for Python 2 and 3
        --------------------------------
        
        We need to define this function to make the doctests compatible.
        
        >>> def assert_equal(expected, returned):
        ...     if expected != returned:
        ...         raise AssertionError("{!r} != {!r}".format(expected, returned))
        
        The collmex object
        ------------------
        
        The collmex object is a central place to access collmex. In the Zope 3 jargon
        it is a global utility:
        
        >>> import os
        >>> import gocept.collmex.collmex
        >>> os.environ['collmex_credential_section'] = 'test-credentials'
        >>> collmex = gocept.collmex.collmex.Collmex()
        
        
        Pre flight cleanup
        ------------------
        
        First we need to clean up the Collmex environment:
        
        >>> import gocept.collmex.testing
        >>> gocept.collmex.testing.cleanup_collmex()
        
        
        Transaction integration
        -----------------------
        
        gocept.collmex has support for transaction integration. All modifying calls are
        buffered until the transaction is commited. XXX explain more.
        
        >>> import transaction
        
        
        Customers: ``create_customer`` and ``get_customers``
        ----------------------------------------------------
        
        >>> customer = gocept.collmex.model.Customer()
        >>> customer[u'Kundennummer'] = 10000
        >>> customer[u'Firma'] = u'Testkunden'
        >>> collmex.create(customer)
        >>> transaction.commit()
        
        Customers can be listed using the get_customers method:
        
        >>> customers = collmex.get_customers()
        >>> customers
        [<gocept.collmex.model.Customer object at 0x...>, <gocept.collmex.model.Customer object at 0x...>]
        >>> len(customers)
        2
        
        The first customer is the generic one:
        
        >>> customer = customers[0]
        >>> assert_equal(u'CMXKND', customer[u'Satzart'])
        >>> assert_equal(u'9999', customer[u'Kundennummer'])
        >>> assert_equal(u'Allgemeiner Gesch\xe4ftspartner', customer[u'Firma'])
        
        The second customer is one created during test setup:
        
        >>> customer = customers[1]
        >>> assert_equal(u'CMXKND', customer[u'Satzart'])
        >>> assert_equal(u'10000', customer[u'Kundennummer'])
        >>> assert_equal(u'Testkunden', customer[u'Firma'])
        
        Products: ``create_product`` and ``get_products``
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        Products are created using the ``create_product`` method:
        
        >>> product = gocept.collmex.model.Product()
        >>> product[u'Produktnummer'] = u'TEST'
        >>> product[u'Bezeichnung'] = u'Testprodukt'
        >>> product[u'Produktart'] = 1 # Dienstleistung
        >>> product[u'Basismengeneinheit'] = u'HR'
        >>> product[u'Verkaufs-Preis'] = 5
        >>> collmex.create(product)
        >>> transaction.commit()
        >>> assert_equal(u'Testprodukt', collmex.get_products()[0][u'Bezeichnung'])
        
        Invoices: ``create_invoice`` and ``get_invoices``
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        Invoices are created using the ``create_invoice`` method:
        
        >>> import datetime
        >>> start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
        >>> item = gocept.collmex.model.InvoiceItem()
        >>> item[u'Kunden-Nr'] = u'10000'
        >>> item[u'Rechnungsnummer'] = 100000
        >>> item[u'Menge'] = 3
        >>> item[u'Produktnummer'] = u'TEST'
        >>> item[u'Rechnungstext'] = u'item text \u2013 with non-ascii characters'
        >>> item[u'Positionstyp'] = 0
        >>> collmex.create_invoice([item])
        
        Invoices can be looked up again, using the ``get_invoices`` method. However, as
        discussed above the invoice was only registered for addition. Querying right
        now does *not* return the invoice:
        
        >>> collmex.get_invoices(customer_id=u'10000', start_date=start_date)
        []
        
        After committing, the invoice is found:
        
        >>> transaction.commit()
        >>> assert_equal(u'item text \u2013 with non-ascii characters',
        ...       collmex.get_invoices(customer_id=u'10000',
        ...                            start_date=start_date)[0][u'Rechnungstext'])
        
        Activities
        ----------
        
        This section describes the API for activities (Taetigkeiten erfassen)
        
        Create an activity
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A project with one set and an employee are required to submit activities:
        
        >>> import datetime
        >>> import gocept.collmex.testing
        >>> gocept.collmex.testing.create_project(u'Testprojekt')
        >>> gocept.collmex.testing.create_employee()
        >>> act = gocept.collmex.model.Activity()
        >>> act[u'Projekt Nr'] = u'1' # Testprojekt
        >>> act[u'Mitarbeiter Nr'] = u'1' # Sebastian Wehrmann
        >>> act[u'Satz Nr'] = u'1' # TEST
        >>> act[u'Beschreibung'] = u'allgemeine T\xe4tigkeit'
        >>> act[u'Datum'] = datetime.date(2012, 1, 23)
        >>> act[u'Von'] = datetime.time(8, 7)
        >>> act[u'Bis'] = datetime.time(14, 28)
        >>> act[u'Pausen'] = datetime.timedelta(hours=1, minutes=12)
        >>> collmex.create(act)
        >>> transaction.commit()
        
        Export using ``get_activities``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``get_activities`` returns Activity objects.
        
        .. ATTENTION:: In previous versions this method returnd a raw CSV string. This
              was due to Collmex not having an actual API.
        
        
        >>> activities = collmex.get_activities()
        >>> assert_equal(u'allgemeine T\xe4tigkeit', activities[0][u'Beschreibung'])
        
        
        Projects: ``get_projects``
        --------------------------
        
        Projects can be exported with the ``get_projects`` API. It returns an entry
        for every project set (Projektsatz) of each project (Projekt):
        
        >>> proj = collmex.get_projects()
        >>> len(proj)
        2
        >>> proj[0][u'Projektnummer'] == proj[1][u'Projektnummer']
        True
        
        >>> assert_equal(u'5,00', proj[0][u'Satz'])
        >>> assert_equal(u'9,65', proj[1][u'Satz'])
        >>> assert_equal(u'0', proj[0][u'Inaktiv'])
        
        Caching
        -------
        
        Results queried from Collmex are cached for the duration of the transaction.
        
        To demonstrate this, we instrument the _post() method that performs the actual
        HTTP communication to show when it is called:
        
            >>> original_post = collmex._post
            >>> def tracing_post(self, *args, **kw):
            ...     print(u'cache miss')
            ...     return original_post(*args, **kw)
            >>> collmex._post = tracing_post.__get__(collmex, type(collmex))
        
        The first time in an transaction is retrieved from Collmex, of course:
        
            >>> transaction.abort()
            >>> assert_equal(u'Testprodukt', collmex.get_products()[0][u'Bezeichnung'])
            cache miss
        
        But after that, values are cached:
        
            >>> assert_equal(u'Testprodukt', collmex.get_products()[0][u'Bezeichnung'])
        
        When the transaction ends, the cache is invalidated:
        
            >>> transaction.commit()
            >>> assert_equal(u'Testprodukt', collmex.get_products()[0][u'Bezeichnung'])
            cache miss
        
            >>> assert_equal(u'Testprodukt', collmex.get_products()[0][u'Bezeichnung'])
        
        Remove tracing instrumentation:
        
            >>> collmex._post = original_post
        
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        1.9 (2019-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Drop support for Python 3.3 and 3.4.
        
        - Add support for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8b4.
        
        - Migrate code to Github.
        
        - Update tests to new Collmex URLs.
        
        
        1.8.3 (2018-03-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented CMXABO, only applicable for "collmex Verein".
        
        
        1.8.2 (2017-01-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented `MITGLIED_GET` as `get_members()` and `CMXMGD`
          as `models.Member`, both only applicable for "collmex Verein".
        
        
        1.8.1 (2016-06-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Extend `Project` to retrieve budget and summed up work via API.
        
        
        1.8.0 (2016-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Declared compatibility with Python 3.4.
        
        - Stopped promising compatibility with Python 3.2 since a) tests don't succeed
          with Python 3.2 and current test software b) nobody uses it anymore anyway.
        
        - Made sure tests don't use invalid credentials on test account too many times
          in a row.
        
        - Raise ``ValueError`` if the Collmex website returned an error during
          ``Collmex.browser_login``. Until now the error was hidden, but the following
          action failed. In particular this should help to spot invalid credentials.
        
        
        
        1.7.0 (2014-09-04)
        ------------------

          automatically allocating invoice ids.
        
        - Add ``gocept.collmex.testing.ConsoleDump`` utility that fakes a collmex
          connection, but only logs method calls.
        
        
        1.5.1 (2013-12-09)
        ------------------

        - Fix the check for invalid credentials when ``gocept.collmex.collmex.Collmex``
          is created.
        
        
        1.4.2 (2013-09-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Credentials to log into Collmex can be given via an `collmex.ini` file.
        
        
        1.4.1 (2013-09-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Creation of test activities is now fully customizable

          changed wich included a rename of form elements.
        
        
        
        1.2 (2012-02-21)
        ----------------
        
        Note: This version was accidentally released without the changes in 1.1.1,
        however, the release itself contained the changes of 1.1 and thus isn't
        broken.
        
        - Add ``Inaktiv`` attribute on ``CMXPRJ`` (projects)

        - Forced usage of Python 2.7.
        
        - Added testing helper ``get_collmex`` to create a collmex object from
          environment variables.
        
        - Made testing helper ``collmex_login()`` a method: ``gocept.collmex.collmex.Collmex.browser_login()``
        
        - Modified signature of testing helper ``create_activity``, so it no longer
          needs a parameter.
        
        
        0.9 (2012-01-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Added testing helper ``create_activity``.
        
        
        0.8 (2012-01-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Added API for retrieving activities (``get_activities``).
        
        - Updated tests and test infrastructure to recent changes in Collmex.

        ----------------
        
        - Make models robust against API changes so they don't immediately break when
          the record becomes longer.
        - Updated customer model to current API.
        
        0.5.1 (2009-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed multi-threading bug: thread-local data needs to be intialized for each
          thread.
        
        0.5 (2008-12-19)

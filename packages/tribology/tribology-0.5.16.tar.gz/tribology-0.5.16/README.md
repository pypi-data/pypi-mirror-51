# known issues

### numpy

The following releases of NumPy may cause file access errors when using data
import and processing routines of the tribology package. It is 
recommended to use the NumPy release(s) specified in [`setup.py`](setup.py).

    1.16.2
    1.16.3

### missing install requires
Some older versions of the tribology package (0.4 <= version < 0.5) may raise the 
following error when imported:

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'

This is caused by a missing `install_requires` argument in
[`setup.py`](./setup.py). To fix this, either update to a later version of the
package, or install the missing `cv2` package manually:

    pip install opencv-python

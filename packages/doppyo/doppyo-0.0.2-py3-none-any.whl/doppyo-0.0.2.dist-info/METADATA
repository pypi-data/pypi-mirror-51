# doppyo

doppyo is a diagnostics/verification package for climate forecast systems. It is still in the very early stages of development.

Current functionality
======================

Three modules are currently available

1. ``skill`` : functions for assessing one data set relative to another (usually model output relative to observation).

2. ``diagnostic`` : functions for computing various atmospheric and oceanic diagnostics.

3. ``utils`` : general support functions for the doppyo package. 

Some test modules are also avaliable in ``doppyo.test``. However, these are far from complete 

Usage (If not using DCFP JupyterHub server)
===========================================

1. Install anaconda if you have not already done so:

* Make your own directory in '/OSM/CBR/OA\_DCFP/apps/'

``mkdir /OSM/CBR/OA_DCFP/apps/<userid>``

* A recent version of the anaconda installer is available in '/OSM/CBR/OA\_DCFP/apps/anaconda\_installer'. Run this and follow the prompts to install anaconda in the directory you have just created.

* The anaconda installer will add the anaconda path to your .bashrc (or equivalent). You will need to source this for the changes to be made:

``source ~/.bashrc``

* Check that anaconda python is now your default:

``which python``

2. Install doppyo:

* Clone the doppyo Bitbucket repository to your local machine. At your desired location, run:

``git clone https://<userid>@bitbucket.csiro.au/scm/df/doppyo.git``

* Replicate the doppyo environment locally. This will ensure that you have all libraries/packages required to run doppyo. Within the 'requirements' folder in your cloned repository, run:  

``conda env create -f doppyo_env_linux.yml``  

or  

``conda env create -f doppyo_env_mac.yml``  

depending on your os.  

Alternatively, if updating an existing doppyo\_env environment, run:  

``conda env update --file=doppyo_env_<os>.yml``

* Activate the doppyo\_env environment:

``source activate doppyo_env``

* Install the doppyo package. Within your cloned repository, run:

``python setup.py install``

        =====
        
        ``great`` is a thing that rates things.
        
        It's a simple media library to collect all the scattered ratings for my media
        which currently live amongst old iTunes library files, Netflix, Jinni,
        GoodReads and a billion other places.
        
        Right now it pretty much works for parsing iTunes.

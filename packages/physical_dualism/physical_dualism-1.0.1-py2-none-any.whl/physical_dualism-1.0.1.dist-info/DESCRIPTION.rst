About
=====

Python library that approximates the natural frequency from stress via physical
dualism, and vice versa.

This work is a part of the investigation within the research project
[ON174027]_, supported by the Ministry for Science and Technology, Republic of
Serbia. This support is gratefully acknowledged.

Installation
============

To install physical_dualism run::

    $ pip install physical_dualism

Usage examples
==============

Quick start::

    >>> from physical_dualism import approximate_natural_frequency_from_stress

    >>> mode = 1
    >>> a = 2310.0 # [mm] strip length
    >>> sigma_cr = 19.4754 # [MPa] critical buckling stress
    >>> ro = 10000.0 / 10**9 # [kg/mm**3] mass density

    # Mass matrix expects mass density normalized to 1 [m] of length, even if everything is done in [mm]
    >>> ro /= 10**3

    # [rad/s] natural frequency approximated from critical buckling stress
    >>> print "%.4f" % approximate_natural_frequency_from_stress(mode, a, sigma_cr, ro)
    60.0179

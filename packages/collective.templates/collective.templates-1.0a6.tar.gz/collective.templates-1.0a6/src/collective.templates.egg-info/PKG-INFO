        ====================
        
        Collective.templates adds a folder to Plone where users could upload document templates
        and set categories e.g. compatibility, license. It's also possible to rate the templates
        and give feedback to the template authors.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - A template center with listing and display of template projects respectively to their rating,
          a search form and a listing of the latest projects.
        - Template projects with the abbility to upload template files and replace them with newer ones.
          The project page contains fields for product versions, categories, licenses and plattforms.
        - The user could send a message to the author of a template via a mail. The mail form uses a
          recaptcha widget. The contact data of the author of the template will not be made public.
        - The file extensions of the uploaded templates will be checked. It is possible to set the
          allowed file extensions distinct for the specific use case of the template center. They
          could be dynamically changed at any time.

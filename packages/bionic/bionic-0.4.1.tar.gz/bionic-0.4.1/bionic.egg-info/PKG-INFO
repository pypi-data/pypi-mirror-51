Description: # Bionic
        
        Bionic is a Python framework for building, running, and sharing data science
        research workflows.  It uses dependency injection to automatically gather
        together your Python functions into a reusable, configurable tool.
        
        Bionic is currently in alpha.  It is suitable for small-to-medium-size research
        projects: i.e., projects that fit in memory, have a small number of
        collaborators, and are intended to generate insight or some data artifact (like
        a model) rather than run in production.  (These constraints will be eliminated
        over time.)  The API will continue to evolve; we will attempt to keep it
        backwards-compatible as long as possible, but there will probably be at least
        one breaking API change in the future.
        
        Since we recently open-sourced this project, we haven't set up our public
        documentation hosting yet.  Check back soon for a link to the docs.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Bionic can be installed from PyPI:
        
            pip install bionic[standard]
        
        You'll probably want to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as well.

        A python package to deal with location history files, such
        as GMAPS takeout json.
        
        The main motivation behind this package is to allow simple analytics
        based on where you have been, for example, how long did you spend
        at the office over January?
        
        
        Supported providers:
        * Google - takeout's json
        
        
        ## Settings
        
        You can customize the runtime parameters through a configuration file
        or command line parameters (requires extension).
        
        
        # Configuration File
        The configuration consist of a yaml file. All the items in it, will be
        exposed as settings to your script.

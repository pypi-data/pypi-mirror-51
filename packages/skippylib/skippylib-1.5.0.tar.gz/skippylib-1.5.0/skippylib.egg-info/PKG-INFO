Description: 
        This module has been developed to provide access to instruments that listen 
        for SCPI protocol connections. It also provides a Tango Device Server.
        
        This code is the natural evolution of previous device servers that had provided
        many functionalities to, with this device, merge them together and make easy
        to develop many more.

Kumparanian |Build Status| |PyPI version|
=========================================

Kumparanian is a set of workflows that optimize Kumparan’s data
engineering and data scientist hiring process. It cuts down 1-2 working
day(s) submission review process to just less than an hour.

If you are our candidate, you need to install ``kumparanian`` using
following command:

::

   pip install kumparanian 

consult its help command:

::

   % kumparanian ds --help
   Usage: kumparanian ds [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

     For Data Scientist role.

     Before you submit your trained model, you can verify your trained model
     using the following command:

     $ kumparanian ds verify YOURMODEL.pickle

     Use the following command to evaluate your trained model against your test
     dataset:

     $ kumparanian ds evaluate YOURMODEL.pickle test_file.csv

   Options:
     --help  Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
     evaluate  Evaluate the model
     verify    Verify the model

     If you found any issues, feel free report it at:
     https://github.com/kumparan/kumparanian/issues

then read our assessment and you should be good.

Subsequent sections are not required for candidate as it intended only
for project’s documentation purpose.

Kumparan’s Model Interface
--------------------------

The first component of Kumparanian is a `Kumparan’s Model
Interface <./interface/model.py>`__. We’ve designed an interface for
Machine Learning model that allows us to design a problem to have
deterministic result.

The model interface contains 3 required methods: ``train``, ``predict``
and ``save``. The candidate will solve the assessment test by implement
the ``train`` and ``predict`` methods. We provide ``save`` method to
helps the candidate to save the trained model.

Read more about the `Kumparan’s Model
Interface <./interface/README.md>`__.

Kumparanian CLI
---------------

The second component of Kumparanian is a ``kumparanian(1)``. This CLI
will help the candidate to verify and test their model while also help
our team to evaluate the candidate’s trained model.

``kumparanian(1)`` can be installed via the following command:

::

   pip install kumparanian

To get started, run the following command:

::

   kumparanian --help

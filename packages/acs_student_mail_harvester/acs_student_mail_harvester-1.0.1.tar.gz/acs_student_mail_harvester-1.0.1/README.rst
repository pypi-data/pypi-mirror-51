Instructions for teaching assistants
------------------------------------

These steps should be performed with your every student group, at the very
start of their first week in the ACS labs:

#. Copy the ``examples/student-info.ini`` file into
   ``ispitni_materijaliA/.eXXXXX/`` and ``ispitni_materijaliB/.eXXXXX/``

#. Ask the administrator to switch the lab to the "exam" mode (aka "provera")

#. Wait for all of the students to login

#. Instruct the students to:

   #. Locate the ``student-info.ini`` file in their ``$HOME/$STUDENT_ID``
      directory

   #. Update the contents of the file with their own information

   #. Save the file and close the editor

   #. Logout

#. Ask the administrator to collect the exam ``.tar`` archive and switch the lab
   to the "normal" mode

Please send your collected exam archives to your professors as soon as you can.

# Multisafepay integration #

This package enables you to talk to a Multisafepay payment provider. 
It is a very minimal implementation, using the now deprecated xml api of Multisafepay.

This package started life under the name 'multisafepay', but is now 'mini-multisafepay'.

The original name has been donated to the Multisafepay developers, so that they can
provide their canonical implementation under the proper name.


For documentation have a look at the tests ("test_msp.py").

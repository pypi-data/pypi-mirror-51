paragrep - Paragraph Grep utility

**paragrep** is a paragraph grep utility. It searches for a series of regular
expressions in a text file (or several text files) and prints out the
paragraphs containing those expressions. Normally **paragrep** displays a
paragraph if it contains any of the expressions; this behavior can be modified
by using the `-a` option.

By default, a paragraph is defined as a block of text delimited by an empty or
blank line; this behavior can be altered with the `-p` option.

If no files are specified on the command line, **paragrep** searches
standard input.

This is the third implementation of **paragrep**. The first implementation,
in 1989, was in C. The second implementation, in 2003, was in perl. This is
the latest and greatest.

For help, run with `-h`.

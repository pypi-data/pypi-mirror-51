## **Katna**: Tool for automating video keyframe extraction 

### Resources 
* Homepage and Reference: <https://keplervaani.com/katna/>

### Description
Katna automates the boring, error prone task of videos key/best frames extraction.
Key-frames are defined as the representative frames of a video stream, the frames that provide the most accurate and compact summary of the video content.


Video module takes following frame extraction and selection method into consideration:

1) Frame extraction from a input video which are sufficiently different using absolute differences in LUV colorspace 
2) Brightness score filtering of extracted frames
3) Entropy/contrast score filtering of extracted frames
4) K-Means clustering of frames using image histogram
5) Selection of best frame from each cluster based on variance of laplacian feature (image blur detection)

More selection features are in developement pipeline

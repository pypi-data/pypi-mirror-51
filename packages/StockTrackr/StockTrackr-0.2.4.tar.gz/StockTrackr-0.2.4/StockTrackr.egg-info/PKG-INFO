        ### Installation
        
        You can use pip to download the package directly:
        
        > pip install StockTrackr
        
        
        Setup the venv by first installing/activating it with:
        
        > ./venv.bat
        
        
        Then, initialize the venv with superset with:
        
        > ./initialize_venv.bat
        
        This creates a new file "run_superset.bat" which can be used to start the server.

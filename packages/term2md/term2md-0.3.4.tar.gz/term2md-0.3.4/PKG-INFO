Summary: convert ANSI terminal control characters to Markdown

Description: # term2md
        
        This is a text processing utility that will convert input containing
        [ANSI escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
        into nearly-equivalent Markdown.
        
        This is not currently a universal converter, since Markdown cannot
        express all of the formatting possible with the ANSI control
        characters. However, it does a reasonable job of handling green, red,
        and bold text.
        
        `term2md` was written originally so that output from a tool designed
        for terminal output could be added via continuous integration as
        comments on pull requests.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        $ pip install term2md
        ```
        
        In addition to installing the core Python module, it will also install
        a `term2md` executable script for you.

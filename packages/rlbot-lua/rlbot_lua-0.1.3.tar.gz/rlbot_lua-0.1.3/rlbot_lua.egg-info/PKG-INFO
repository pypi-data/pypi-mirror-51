Description: # RLBot_Lua
        
        This extension creates a native bridge between Python and Lua, implementing its own class system to simplify usage.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        $ python -m pip install rlbot_lua
        ``` 
        
        > Note: Only supports 64-bit OS/Python
        
        ## Bot setup
        Copy the following files to your bot folder:
        
        - Lua53.dll (Not needed on Linux when support arrives)
        - classes.lua
        - structs.lua
        - lua_bot.py
        
        Then, in your bot.cfg, set bot path to `lua_bot.py`
        
        ## Functions provided
        
        Functions:
        - `class` - A keyword to create classes (see bot_example.lua and structs.lua for reference)
        - `super` - A function useful with inheritance; calls the parent function (see structs.lua for reference)
        - `dump` - A function that can be used to dump information about a table
        
        Classes:
        - `GameTickPacket` - The game tick packet, this completely copies the python packet
        - `GameObject` - Base class for all entities in the game, this should generally not be used
        - `GameCar` - The class used for cars in packet.game_cars
        - `GameBall` - The class used for the ball
        - `GameInfo` - The class used to hold information about the current game
        - `GameBoost` - The class used for boost pads in packet.game_boosts
        - `Team` - The class used for team information
        - `Hitbox` - Container class for hitbox data
        - `ControllerState` - The class used to hold controller data, defaults to neutral
        - `LuaBot` - The class a bot written in Lua must inherit and implement
        - `Vector` - The class used for all 3-dimensional vectors, has utility methods
        - `Rotation` - The class used for rotation data
        
        These classes can be modified as shown in example_bot.lua
        
        ## TODO
        
        - Proper classes for Ball attributes
        - FieldInfo
        - Figure out why it segfaults when there are more than 2 players on the field

Table 3 and Table 4:

Table 3 Caption:
    Note. CO (1-0) line fluxes from Young et al. (1995); 
    SPIRE 350 and 500 μm fluxes from Dale et al. (2012; except NGC 5194—Herschel VNGS data release Wilson et al.) 
    with a multiplicative factor of 0.95 for extended source color correction (see Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2015). 
    The 850 μm fluxes listed in column 8 were extrapolated from the 500 μm fluxes assuming a spectral index 
    of β = 1.8 and ΓRJ appropriate for Td = 25 K. 
    L{\nu}850{\mu}m was computed from the observed fluxes using Equation (10).

Table 4 Caption:
    Note. CO (1-0) line fluxes from: (1) Sanders et al. 1991), (2) Solomon et al. 1997), and (3) Sanders et al. 1989); 
    SPIRE 350 and 500 μm fluxes from J. Chu et al. (2016, in preparation) for all galaxies 
    except Arp 220 (Herschel VNGS data release Wilson et al.). 
    L{nu}850{mu}m was computed from the observed fluxes using Equation (10).

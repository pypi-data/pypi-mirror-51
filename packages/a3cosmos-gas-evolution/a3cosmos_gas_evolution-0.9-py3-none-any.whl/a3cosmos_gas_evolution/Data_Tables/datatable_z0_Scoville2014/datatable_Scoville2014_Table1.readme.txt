Notes
    Submillimeter flux measurements and ISM masses from Dale et al. (2005), 
    Clements et al. (2010), and the NASA Extragalactic Database. 
    HI masses were set to 50% of the molecular gas masses. 
    Uncertainties in the derived H2 masses are dominated by 
    the assumed CO-to-H2 conversion factor, which is 
    uncertain by ∼±25% even for normal low-level 
    star-forming galaxies.

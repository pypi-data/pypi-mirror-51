Description: rfpipe supports fast transient searching of radio interferometric data.
        This is written as part of the realfast project will perform real-time commensal
        fast radio transient searches at the Very Large Array. rfpipe supports both
        real-time and offline searches, GPU and CPU algorithms, and reproducible analysis of
        transients found by realfast. More project info at http://realfast.io.

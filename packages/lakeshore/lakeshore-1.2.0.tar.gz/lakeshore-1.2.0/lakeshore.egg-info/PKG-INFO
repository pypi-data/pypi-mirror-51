        The [Lake Shore](https://www.lakeshore.com) python driver allows users to quickly and easily communicate with Lake Shore instruments. It automatically establishes a connection and provides a variety of functions specific to the product that configure settings and acquire measurements. 
        
        ## Supported Products

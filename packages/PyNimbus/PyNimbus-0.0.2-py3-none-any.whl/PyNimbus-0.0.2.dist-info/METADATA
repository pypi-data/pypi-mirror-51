# PyNimbus

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pynimbus/badge/?version=latest)](https://pynimbus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

PyNimbus's goal is to take the "middle man" out of downloading and sorting data found from various National Weather Service products such as NHC and SPC outlooks. This is accomplished through the PyNimbus API. 

PyNimbus follows the [semantic version](https://semver.org/) numbering system.

# Installing PyNimbus

PyNimbus can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install pynimbusÂ 
```

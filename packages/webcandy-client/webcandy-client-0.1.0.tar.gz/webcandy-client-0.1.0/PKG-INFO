Description: # Webcandy Client
        Client-side code for communicating with the Webcandy server and controlling lighting configuration. This should be run by the machine with LEDs connected to it via Fadecandy.
        
        ## Installation
        The easiest way to install is to run `pip install webcandy-client`. If you want the absolute latest code, you can clone this repository and run `pip install -e .` from the root directory.
        
        ## Running
        To run the client in order to receive lighting change requests from the server, use the `wc-client` executable:
        
        `$ wc-client <username> <password> <client_id>`.
        
        To manually change the lighting configuration offline, use the `wc-controller` executable:
        
        `$ wc-controller --file <config JSON path>`
        
        For usage information on either script, pass `--help`.

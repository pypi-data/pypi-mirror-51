AdvancedAnalytics
===================

A collection of python modules, classes and methods for simplifying building machine learning solutions.  This was developed to simplify learning python, and it accompanies the book *The Art and Science of Data Analytics*.

Description
===========

Machine learning applications progress through three stages:

    1. Data Preprocessing
    2. Modeling or Analytics
    3. Postprocessing

The classes and methods in **AdvancedAnalytics** primarily support the first and last stages of machine learning applications. 

Surprisingly data scientists report they typically spend 80% of their total effort in data preprocessing and postprocessing. The first stage is concerned with preparing the data for analysis.

    1. identifying and correcting outliers, 
    2. imputing missing values, and 
    3. encoding data. 

The last stage, solution postprocessing, involves displaying and graphing solution summaries as well as metrics and graphics used to evaluate the quality of the solution.

Usage
=====

Currently the most popular usage is for supporting solutions developed using these popular machine learning packages:

    * Sci-Learn
    * StatsModels
    * NLTK

Documentation and Examples
============================

The API and documentation for all classes and examples are available at https://github.com/tandonneur/AdvancedAnalytics . 

Installation and Dependencies
=============================

**AdvancedAnalytics** is designed to work on any operating system running python 3.  It can be installed using **pip** or **conda**.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install AdvancedAnalytics
    # or
    conda install -c conda-forge AdvancedAnalytics

General Dependencies
    There are dependencies.  Most classes import one or more modules from    
    **Sci-Learn**, referenced as *sklearn* in module imports, and 
    **StatsModels**.  These are both installed in with current versions
    of **anaconda**, a popular application for coding python solutions.

Decision Tree and Random Forest Dependencies
    The *Tree* and *Forest* modules plot decision trees and importance
    metrics using **pydotplus** and the **graphviz** packages.  If these
    are not installed and you are planning to use the *Tree* or *Forest*
    modules, they can be installed using the following code.

    .. code-block:: python

        conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
        conda install -c conda-forge graphviz
        pip install graphviz

    One note, the second conda install does not complete the install of 
    the graphviz package.  To complete the graphviz install, it is 
    necessary to run the pip install after the conda graphviz install.

Text Analytics Dependencies
    The *TextAnalytics* module is based on the **NLTK** and **Sci-Learn**
    text analytics packages.  They are both installed with the current 
    version of anaconda. 

    However, *TextAnalytics* includes options to produce word clouds, 
    which are graphic displays of the word collections associated with 
    topic or data clusters.  The **wordcloud** package is used to produce
    these graphs.  If you are using the *TextAnalytics* module you can
    install the **wordcloud** package with the following code.

    .. code-block:: console

        conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud

    In addition, data used by the **NLTK** package is not automatically 
    installed with this package.  These data include the text 
    dictionary and other data tables.

    The following nltk.download commands should be run before using 
    **TextAnalytics**. However, it is only necessary to run these once to 
    download and install the data NLTK uses for text analytics.

    .. code-block:: console

        #The following NLTK commands should be run once to 
        #download and install NLTK data.
        nltk.download(?punkt?)
        nltk.download(?averaged_preceptron_tagger?)
        nltk.download(?stopwords?)
        nltk.download(?wordnet?)

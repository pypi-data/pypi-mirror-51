"""Micro-library implementating logic to find all common subsequences.

Implementation of the calACS-DP (all common subsequences - dynamic programming)
algorithm as presented in Hui Wang's "All common subsequences."
IJCAI 2007:635-640 (ACM). This Micro-library also introduces a variation which
can produce a list all of those common subsequences. Additionally, both the
classic implementation as well as the variation offer some space optimizations
similar to those found in longest common subsequence imeplementations.

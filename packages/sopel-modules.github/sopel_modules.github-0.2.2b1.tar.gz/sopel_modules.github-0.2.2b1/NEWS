Changes in 0.2.2b1
==================

Changed:
* Truncate comments to 250 characters (no PR yet)


Changes in 0.2.1
================

Fixed:
* Comments containing blank lines would cause errors (#43)


Changes in 0.2.0
================

Added:
* Handling for several new event types:
  * Pull request reviews (#20)
  * Pull request assignments (#23)
  * Pull request labels (#23)
  * Pull request milestones (#35)
  * Issue & pull request title edits (#36)
  * Releases (#21)
* Handling of draft pull requests (#34)
* Handling for draft pull requests marked ready for review (#34)
* Converting `:emoji:` to Unicode emoji in most text output (#17)
  * Requires optional dependency: https://pypi.org/project/emoji/

Changed:
* `secret` setting is now called `client_secret` (#42)
  * The plugin will automatically migrate configs to use the new name, but
    manual editing is encouraged in advanced setups (e.g. if the user Sopel
    runs as cannot write to the config file)
* Quoted text is ignored when generating comment output (#41)
* Unicode ellipsis now used instead of three periods (#31)
* Oxford comma now used in generated lists (#40)
* Webhook payload processing is handed off to a separate thread (#22)
  * Bottle can handle only one request at a time; doing this should minimize
    the potential for failed deliveries, as GitHub's webhook delivery service
    times out very quickly

Fixed:
* GitHub URL regexes should match all possible usernames & repo names (#38)
  * Of particular note: dots (`.`) are now recognized in repository links,
    such as Sopel's website repo: https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel.chat


Changes in 0.2.0a16
===================

Merged all updates from `master` branch, and update emoji parsing


Changes in 0.2.0a15
===================

Fixed:
* Actually fire event handler for PRs marked `ready_for_review`


Changes in 0.1.7
================

Fixed:
* Error with empty issue/PR description or commit message (#39)


Changes in 0.2.0a14
===================

Fixed:
* Empty issue/PR description or empty commit message won't throw errors any
  more (#39)


Changes in 0.2.0a13
===================

Changed:
* Arrow character used in title edit output had limited mobile support; switched
  to one that appears to be available just about everywhere

Fixed:
* Stop trying to get milestone name for "demilestoned" payloads (GitHub
  doesn't send that information, unfortunately)

Meta:
* Alpha branch is now based on version 0.1.6


Changes in 0.1.6
================

Changed:
* Webhook now says "merged" instead of "closed" for merged PRs (#18)
* Re-opened issues/PRs will also trigger the webhook now (#27)

Fixed:
* Webhook ignores issue, PR, and review comments that were edited (#16, #24)
* Commit summary correctly says "1 file" instead of "1 files" (#37)
* Some webhook output grammar fixed (#15)
* Handle comments submitted via email correctly WRT line-endings (#30)

Changes in 0.2.0a12
===================

Fixed:

* Emit an event to IRC when an issue or PR title is edited (#36)


Changes in 0.2.0a10
===================

Added:
* Emit an event to IRC when an issue or PR milestone is added/removed (#35)


Changes in 0.2.0a9
==================

Changed:
* URL regexes should be more faithful to GitHub's actual restrictions
  * Neither usernames nor repo names can contain underscore (`_`), so we
    shouldn't accept it
  * Repo names can contain dot (`.`), which the old regex didn't allow
  * Usernames have a maximum length, which we are now looking for

Fixed:
* Unnecessary parentheses added in previous alpha release
  * Apparently, `pip install --upgrade --pre` can install the wrong release,
    making one's testing unreliable.


Changes in 0.2.0a8
==================

Fixed:
* Developer stupidity regarding inline conditionals


Changes in 0.2.0a7
==================

Fixed:
* Developer stupidity regarding types


Changes in 0.2.0a6
==================

Changed:
* Handler for commit links now outputs "1 file" instead of "1 files" if the
  linked commit changed only one file


Changes in 0.2.0a5
==================

Added:
* Webhook handling of draft pull requests (both opening and marking ready)

Fixed:
* Sopel's development version finally marked `SopelMemory.contains()` as
  deprecated, so we don't use it any more


Changes in 0.2.0a4
==================

Fixed:
* Empty PR reviews caused HTTP 500 because of how they were skipped (they
  should now return HTTP 200 as normal)


Changes in 0.2.0a3
==================

Added:
* Handle when issues/PRs are "reopened" (#27)


Changes in 0.2.0a2
==================

Fixed:
* Polymorphism is hard in label/assignee events (getting the PR number caused
  errors because sometimes GitHub *does* use `pull_request` instead of `issue`)


Changes in 0.2.0a1
==================

Added:
* Handle label & assignee events for PRs too, not just issues (#23)

Changed:
* Edits to review comments also ignored (#24)


Changes in 0.2.0a0
==================

Added:
* Conversion of :emoji: to Unicode emoji in some places, if the required
  library is installed (#17)
* Handling of PR reviews and release events (#20, #21)

Changed:
* Merged PRs are now distinct from closed PRs (#18)
* Grammar updated, mostly around comment-type notifications (#15)
* Edits to existing comments are ignored (no more duplicates) (#16)


Changes in 0.1.5
================

Fixed:
* Refactoring unintentionally broke registering new repo webhooks (#14)

Meta:
* PyPI package description should be rendered to HTML now (fixed content-type)


Changes in 0.1.4
================

Changed:
* "GitHub" is now properly capitalized everywhere in text output. (#9)
* Usage output uses `help_prefix` from config instead of hardcoded `.` (#12)

Fixed:
* git.io shortening was cutting off GET parameters of input links. (#11)


Changes in 0.1.3
================

Meta:
* Moved to Sopel organization on GitHub; new maintainer.

Changed:
* Uses requests instead of deprecated sopel.web functions. (Sopel itself
  requires requests, so we don't have to.)
* Fetched git.io links use HTTPS now.

Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        Version 1.x can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  Missing is internal <xref/> links to
        figures and tables.
        
        The default XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool.
        With version 1.3.0 of the tool, output according to RFC 7991 [2]_ is available
        by use of the '-3' switch.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.5.0 (03 Sep 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed a few Python 3.x nits in the parser code.
        
          * Changed generated anchor slugs so as to not collide with IDs used by 
            xml2rfc, which in v3 mode reserves certain prefixes used for section, 
            figure and table anchors and fragment identifiers.  Also fixed an xml2rfc 
            v2v3 convertere compatibility issue.
        
          * Added outdent to id2xml progress statements in order to more clearly 
            differentiate them from warnings and errors.
        
          * Added the possibility of setting document stream, IPR, and consensus 
            values with switches instead of deriving them from the 'Status of this 
            Memo' section, to make processing of documents with old status wording 
            easier.
        
          * Added a list of valid submission types and stream names to id2xml.utils.
        
          * Tweaked several command-line options to better match those of xml2rfc.  
            Added help for trace options when --help is given together with --debug.
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 1.4.4 (17 Oct 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Since '--' isn't allowed inside html comments, trying to add a comment 
            that contains that string will fail.  Under some circumstances, id2xml
            inserts comments about conversion errors into the generated xml, and
            if the failed text contained '--', this would fail.  Tweaked comment
            insertion to avoid this.
        
          * Added code to look for Abstract both before and after Status-of-Memo 
            and Copyright sections.  The placement of the Abstract changes around the 
            time of RFC 5550.

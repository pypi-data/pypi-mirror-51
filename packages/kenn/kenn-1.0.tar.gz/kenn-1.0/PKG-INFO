Description: KENN (Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks) is a library for python 2.7 built on top of TensorFlow which permits to enhance neural networks models with logical constraints (clauses). It does so by adding a new final layer, called Knowledge Enhancer (KE), to the existing neural network. The KE change the orginal predictions of the standard neural network enforcing the satisfaction of the constraints. Additionally, it contains clause weights, learnable parameters associated to the constraints that represent their strength.

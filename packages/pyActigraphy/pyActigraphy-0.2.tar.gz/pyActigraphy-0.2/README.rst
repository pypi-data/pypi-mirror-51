**pyActigraphy**
================
Open-source python package for actigraphy data analysis.


This package is meant to provide a comprehensive set of tools to:

* read actigraphy raw data files with various formats
* calculate typical wake/sleep cycle-related variables (ex: IS, IV, ...)
* perform complex analyses (ex: FDA, SSA, HMM, ...)

Requirements
============
* python 3.X
* joblib
* pandas
* numba
* numpy
* pyexcel
* pyexcel-ods3
* scipy
* statsmodels

Installation
============
In a (bash) shell, simply type:

* For users:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install pyActigraphy

To update the package:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install -U pyActigraphy

It is strongly recommended to use the latest version of the pyActigraphy package.


* For developers:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone git@github.com:ghammad/pyActigraphy.git
  cd pyActigraphy/
  git checkout develop
  pip install -e .

Quick start
===========

The following example illustrates how to calculate the interdaily stability
with the pyActigraphy package:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import pyActigraphy
  >>> rawAWD = pyActigraphy.io.read_raw_awd('/path/to/your/favourite/file.AWD')
  >>> rawAWD.IS()
  0.6900175913031027
  >>> rawAWD.IS(freq='30min', binarize=True, threshold=4)
  0.6245582891144925
  >>> rawAWD.IS(freq='1H', binarize=False)
  0.5257020914453097

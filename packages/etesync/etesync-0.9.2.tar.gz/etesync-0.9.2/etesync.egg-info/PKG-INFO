Description: This module provides a python API to interact with an EteSync server. It
        currently implements AddressBook and Calendar access, and supports
        two-way sync (both push and pull) to the server. It doesn't currently
        implement pushing raw journal entries which are needed for people
        implementing new EteSync journal types which will be implemented soon.

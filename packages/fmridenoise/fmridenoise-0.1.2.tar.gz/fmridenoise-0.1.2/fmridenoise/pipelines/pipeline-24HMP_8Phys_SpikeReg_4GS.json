  "description": "Denoising strategy based on regressing out: 24HMP - 24 head motion parameters including: 3 translations, 3 rotations, their temporal derivatives, and their quadratic terms (Satterthwaite et al., 2013), 8Phys - mean physiological signals from white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), their temporal derivatives, and quadratic terms (Satterthwaite et al., 2013), SpikeReg - spike regressors based on FD and DVARS thresholds (Power et al., 2013). Pipeline additionally includes global signal regression (GS), its temporal derivative, and quadratic terms (4GS).",

*Prost!* (PRocessing Of Short Transcripts) can analyze smallRNA sequencing data
generated on any sequencing platform. *Prost!* does not rely on existing
annotation to filter sequencing reads but instead starts by aligning all the
reads on a user-provided genomic reference, allowing the study of miRNAs in any
species. Additionally, any number of samples can be studied together in a
single *Prost!* run, allowing an accurate analysis of an entire dataset. After
grouping the processed reads by genomic location, *Prost!* then annotates them
using a user-defined annotation database (public or personal annotation
database). Genomic alignment, grouping, and then annotation enable the study of
potentially novel miRNAs, as well as permitting the retention of all the
isomiRs that a miRNA may display. Finally *Prost!* contains additional features
such as grouping by seed sequence for a more functional approach of the
dataset, provides automatic discovery of potential mirror-miRNAs, and analyzes
the frequency of various types of post-transcriptional modifications at each
genomic location. Each step of the *Prost!* analysis is provided in an Excel
output file so that the user have access to all information for deeper analysis
of specific cases.

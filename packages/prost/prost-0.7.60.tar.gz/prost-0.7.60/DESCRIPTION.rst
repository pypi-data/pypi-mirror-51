microRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small noncoding RNAs (~22nt) with
multiple and widespread regulatory roles in many development and disease
processes. We have created the tool Prost! to explore metazoan miRNA-enriched
RNA-Seq data. Prost! quantifies and normalizes expression levels (in the form
of Illumina reads) in several views that are suitable as input into
differential expression software such as DESeq2. Some key features of Prost!
include the identification of both candidate mirror-miRNAs and putative 5 ́/3 ́
mature miRNA arm switching. Of particular interest is the tightly regulated
post-transcriptional modification of miRNAs via multiple modes of regulation
during their biogenesis. Such modifications have been found to have important
consequences on characteristics such as Argonaute loading, target choice, and
miRNA turnover. Prost! provides valuable quantification across samples of
several classes of miRNA modifications, for example putative seed shifting,
seed editing, and untemplated 3 ́ nucleotide additions.

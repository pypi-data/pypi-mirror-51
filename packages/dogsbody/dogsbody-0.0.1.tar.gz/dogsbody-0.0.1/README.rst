Dogsbody
========
A tool to create and execute a "special setup"/"data file".

Install
-------
::

  pip install dogsbody

How to use
----------
The "special setup" is a directory with at least one file. The main.sh file is
executed and run your custom commands. To pass the directory, it is compressed
into a file. You can also add other stuff to the source directory.

Encryption
----------
To use the encryption (the -p option) you have to install "cryptography".::

  pip install cryptography

Commands
--------
Some information::

  dogsbody --help

Create the "data file"/"special setup"::

  dogsbody create source filename

Executed the "special setup"::

  dogsbody run source

And now both with activated encryption::

  dogsbody -p "1234" create source filename
  dogsbody -p "1234" run source

Why?
----
I need to setup a project on a raspberry pi. It should be a single file
including everything.

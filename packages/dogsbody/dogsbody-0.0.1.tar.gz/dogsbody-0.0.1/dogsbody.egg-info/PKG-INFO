        Dogsbody
        ========
        A tool to create and execute a "special setup"/"data file".
        
        Install
        -------
        ::
        
          pip install dogsbody
        
        How to use
        ----------
        The "special setup" is a directory with at least one file. The main.sh file is
        executed and run your custom commands. To pass the directory, it is compressed
        into a file. You can also add other stuff to the source directory.
        
        Encryption
        ----------
        To use the encryption (the -p option) you have to install "cryptography".::
        
          pip install cryptography
        
        Commands
        --------
        Some information::
        
          dogsbody --help
        
        Create the "data file"/"special setup"::
        
          dogsbody create source filename
        
        Executed the "special setup"::
        
          dogsbody run source
        
        And now both with activated encryption::
        
          dogsbody -p "1234" create source filename
          dogsbody -p "1234" run source
        
        Why?
        ----
        I need to setup a project on a raspberry pi. It should be a single file
        including everything.

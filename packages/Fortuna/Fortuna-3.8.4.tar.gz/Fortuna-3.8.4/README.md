# Fortuna: A Collection of Random Value Generators for Python3
Fortuna's main goal is to provide a quick and easy way to build custom random-value generators for your data.

The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the Storm RNG Engine. While Storm is a high quality random engine, Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is meant for games, data science, A.I. and experimental programming, not security.

#### Numeric Limits:
- Integer: 64 bit signed integer.
    - Range: ±9223372036854775807, approximately ±9.2 billion billion
- Float: 64 bit floating point.
    - Range: ±1.7976931348623157e+308
    - Epsilon Delta: 5e-324


#### Project Terminology:
- Value: Almost anything in Python can be a Value.
    - Expressions, Generators, and F-strings should be wrapped in a lambda for dynamic evaluation.
- Callable: Any callable object, function, method or lambda.
- Collection: A group of Values.
    - List, Tuple, Set, etc... Any object that can be converted into a list via `list(some_object)`.
    - Comprehensions that produce a Collection also qualify.
    - Fortuna classes that wrap a Collection can wrap a Collection, Sequence or generator.
    - Fortuna functions that take a Collection as input will always require a Sequence.
- Sequence: An ordered Collection.
    - List, tuple or list comprehension.
    - A Sequence is an ordered Collection that can be indexed like a list, without conversion.
    - All Sequences are Collections but not all Collections are Sequences.
- Pair: Collection of two Values.
- Table: Collection of Pairs.
- Matrix: Dictionary of Collections.
- Inclusive Range.
    - `[1, 10] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
- Exclusive Range.
    - `(0, 11) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
- Partially Exclusive Range.
    - `[1, 11) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
    - `(0, 10] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
- Automatic Flattening.
    - Works with: RandomValue, TruffleShuffle, QuantumMonty, WeightedChoice & FlexCat.
    - Lazy Evaluation. All Random Value Generator Classes in Fortuna will recursively call or "flatten" callable objects returned from the data at call time.
    - Mixing callable objects with un-callable objects is fully supported, but it can look a bit messy.
    - Nested callable objects are fully supported. Because `lambda(lambda) -> lambda` fixes everything for arbitrary values of 'because', 'fixes' and 'everything'.
    - To disable automatic flattening, pass the optional keyword argument `flat=False` to the constructor.
    - **Under development:** It will soon be possible to auto-flatten callable objects that require multiple arguments. RandomValue already supports this feature.

## Random Value Generators

### Fortuna.RandomValue
`Fortuna.RandomValue(data: Collection, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param data :: Collection of Values.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to automatically flatten callable values with lazy evaluation.
- @return :: Callable Object. `Callable(*args, zero_cool=random_index, range_to=0, **kwargs) -> Value`
    - @param zero_cool :: Optional ZeroCool Method, kwarg only. Default = random_index().
    - @param range_to :: Optional Integer in range [-N, N] where N is the length of the Collection. 
        - Default = 0, kwarg only. Parameter for ZeroCool Method.
        - Negative values of range_to indicate ranging from the back of the Collection. 
    - @param *args, **kwargs :: Optional arguments used to flatten the return Value.
    - @return Value or Value(*args, **kwargs) if it's Callable.

```python
from Fortuna import RandomValue, front_linear, back_linear

# Data Setup
random_apple = RandomValue(("Delicious", "Empire", "Granny Smith", "Honey Crisp", "Macintosh"))
random_fruit = RandomValue((
    lambda: f"Apple, {random_apple()}",
    "Banana",
    "Cherry",
    "Grapes",
    "Orange",
))

# Usage
print(random_fruit())
# prints a random fruit with the default flat uniform distribution

print(random_fruit(zero_cool=back_linear))
# prints a random fruit with a back_linear distribution

print(random_fruit(range_to=3))
# prints a random fruit of the first 3

print(random_fruit(zero_cool=front_linear, range_to=-3))
# prints a random fruit of the last 3 with a front_linear distribution of that range.
```


### TruffleShuffle
`Fortuna.TruffleShuffle(data: Collection, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- Non-destructive, copies the data once.
- @param data :: Collection of Values. Set recommended but not required.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to automatically flatten callable values with lazy evaluation.
- @return :: Callable
    - @return :: Random value from the list with a **Wide Uniform Distribution**. The average width of the output distribution will naturally scale up with the size of the set.

**Wide Uniform Distribution**: *"Wide"* refers to the average distance between consecutive occurrences of the same value in the output sequence. The goal of this type of distribution is to keep the output sequence free of clumps or streaks of the same value, while maintaining randomness and uniform probability. This is not the same as a *flat uniform distribution*. The two distributions over time will be statistically similar for any given set, but the repetitiveness of the output sequence will be very different.

#### TruffleShuffle, Basic Use
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle

# Data Setup
list_of_values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(list_of_values)

# Usage
print(truffle_shuffle())  # this will print one of the numbers 1-6, 
# over time it will produce a wide distribution.
```

#### RandomValue with Auto Flattening Callable Objects
```python
from Fortuna import RandomValue


auto_flat = RandomValue([lambda: 1, lambda: 2, lambda: 3])
print(auto_flat())  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3.
# Note: the lambda will not be called until call time and stays dynamic for the life of the object.

auto_flat_with = RandomValue([lambda x: x, lambda x: x + 1, lambda x:  x + 2])
print(auto_flat_with(2))  # will print the value 2, 3 or 4
# Note: if this is called with no args it will simply return the lambda in an uncalled state.

un_flat = RandomValue([lambda: 1, lambda: 2, lambda: 3], flat=False)
print(un_flat()())  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3, 
# mind the double-double parenthesis, they are required to manually unpack the lambdas

auto_un_flat = RandomValue([lambda x: x, lambda x: x + 1, lambda x:  x + 2], flat=False)
# Note: flat=False is not required here because the lambdas can not be called without input x satisfied.
# It is still recommended to specify flat=False if non-flat output is intend.
print(auto_un_flat()(1))  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3, mind the double-double parenthesis
```

#### Mixing Static Objects with Callable Objects
```python
from Fortuna import RandomValue


""" With automatic flattening active, lambda() -> int can be treated as an int. """
mixed_flat = RandomValue([1, 2, lambda: 3])
print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1, 2 or 3

mixed_un_flat = RandomValue([1, 2, lambda: 3], flat=False) # this pattern is not recommended.
print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1, 2 or "Function <lambda at some_address>"
# This pattern is not recommended because you wont know the nature of what you get back.
# This is almost always not what you want, and it can give rise to messy logic in other areas of your code.
```

#### Dynamic Strings
To successfully express a dynamic string, and keep it dynamic, at least one level of indirection is required. Without an indirection the f-string would collapse into a static string too soon.

```python
from Fortuna import RandomValue, d


# d() is a simple dice function, d(n) -> [1, n] flat uniform distribution.
dynamic_string = RandomValue((
    # while the probability of all A == all B == all C, individual probabilities of each possible string will differ based on the number of possible outputs of each category.
    lambda: f"A{d(2)}",  # -> A1 - A2, each are twice as likely as any particular B, and three times as likely as any C.
    lambda: f"B{d(4)}",  # -> B1 - B4, each are half as likely as any particular A, and 3/2 as likely as any C.
    lambda: f"C{d(6)}",  # -> C1 - C6, each are 1/3 as likely as any particular A and 2/3 as likely of any B.
))

print(dynamic_string())  # prints a random dynamic string, flattened at call time.

"""
>>> distribution_timer(dynamic_string)
Output Analysis: RandomValue(collection)()
Typical Timing: 875 ± 15 ns
Distribution of 100000 Samples:
 A1: 16.657%
 A2: 16.777%
 B1: 8.408%
 B2: 8.266%
 B3: 8.334%
 B4: 8.203%
 C1: 5.635%
 C2: 5.641%
 C3: 5.468%
 C4: 5.537%
 C5: 5.528%
 C6: 5.546%
 """
```

#### Nesting Dolls
```python
from Fortuna import RandomValue

# Data Setup
nesting_dolls = RandomValue({
    RandomValue({"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}),
    RandomValue({"F", "G", "H", "I", "J"}),
    RandomValue({"K", "L", "M", "N", "O"}),
    RandomValue({"P", "Q", "R", "S", "T"}),
    ...
})

# Usage
print(nesting_dolls())  # prints one of the letters A-T
```

### QuantumMonty
`Fortuna.QuantumMonty(data: Collection, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param data :: Collection of Values.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to automatically flatten callable values with lazy evaluation.
- @return :: Callable Object with Monty Methods for producing various distributions of the data.
    - @return :: Random value from the data. The instance will produce random values from the list using the selected distribution model or "monty". The default monty is the Quantum Monty Algorithm.

```python
from Fortuna import QuantumMonty

# Data Setup
list_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
monty = QuantumMonty(list_of_values)

# Usage
print(monty())               # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                             # uses the default Quantum Monty Algorithm.

print(monty.flat_uniform())  # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                             # uses the "flat_uniform" monty.
                             # equivalent to random.choice(list_of_values).
```
The QuantumMonty class represents a diverse collection of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the output distribution is based on the method you choose. Generally speaking, each value in the sequence will have a probability that is based on its position in the sequence. For example: the "front" monty produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. Given enough samples the "front" monty will always converge to a 45 degree slope down for any list of unique values.

There are three primary method families: linear, gaussian, and poisson. Each family has three base methods; 'front', 'middle', 'back', plus a 'quantum' method that incorporates all three base methods. The quantum algorithms for each family produce distributions by overlapping the probability waves of the other methods in their family. The Quantum Monty Algorithm incorporates all nine base methods.

```python
import Fortuna

# Data Setup
monty = Fortuna.QuantumMonty(
    ["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"]
)

# Usage
# Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
# Each method has its own unique distribution model.
""" Flat Base Case """
monty.flat_uniform()        # Flat Uniform Distribution
""" Geometric Positional """
monty.front_linear()        # Linear Descending, Triangle
monty.middle_linear()       # Linear Median Peak, Equilateral Triangle
monty.back_linear()         # Linear Ascending, Triangle
monty.quantum_linear()      # Linear Overlay, 3-way monty.
""" Gaussian Positional """
monty.front_gauss()         # Front Gamma
monty.middle_gauss()        # Scaled Gaussian
monty.back_gauss()          # Reversed Gamma
monty.quantum_gauss()       # Gaussian Overlay, 3-way monty.
""" Poisson Positional """
monty.front_poisson()       # 1/4 Mean Poisson
monty.middle_poisson()      # 1/2 Mean Poisson
monty.back_poisson()        # 3/4 Mean Poisson
monty.quantum_poisson()     # Poisson Overlay, 3-way monty.
""" Quantum Monty Algorithm """
monty()                     # Quantum Monty Algorithm, 9-way monty.
monty.quantum_monty()       #  same as above
```

### Weighted Choice: Base Class
Weighted Choice offers two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where programmable rarity is desired. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values.

The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.

#### Cumulative Weighted Choice
`Fortuna.CumulativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted pairs.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to automatically flatten callable values with lazy evaluation.
- @return :: Callable Instance
    - @return :: Random value from the weighted_table, distribution based on the weights of the values.

_Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_

```python
from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice

# Data Setup
cum_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice((
    (7, "Apple"),
    (11, "Banana"),
    (13, "Cherry"),
    (23, "Grape"),
    (26, "Lime"),
    (30, "Orange"),  # same as relative weight 4 because 30 - 26 = 4
))
# Usage
print(cum_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
```

#### Relative Weighted Choice
`Fortuna.RelativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted pairs.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to automatically flatten callable values with lazy evaluation.
- @return :: Callable Instance
    - @return :: Random value from the weighted_table, distribution based on the weights of the values.

```python
from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice

# Data
population = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape", "Lime", "Orange"]
rel_weights = [7, 4, 2, 10, 3, 4]

# Setup
rel_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice(zip(rel_weights, population))

# Usage
print(rel_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
```

### FlexCat
`Fortuna.FlexCat(dict_of_lists: Matrix, key_bias="front_linear", val_bias="truffle_shuffle", flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
- @param dict_of_lists :: Keyed Matrix of Value Sequences.
- @parm key_bias :: String indicating the name of the algorithm to use for random key selection.
- @parm val_bias :: String indicating the name of the algorithm to use for random value selection.
- @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to automatically flatten callable values with lazy evaluation.
- @return :: Callable Instance
    - @param cat_key :: Optional String. Default is None. Key selection by name. If specified, this will override the key_bias for a single call.
    - @return :: Value. Returns a random value generated with val_bias from a random sequence generated with key_bias.

FlexCat is like a two dimensional QuantumMonty, or a QuantumMonty of QuantumMontys.

The constructor takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms to be used to make random selections. The algorithm specified for selecting a key need not be the same as the one for selecting values. An optional key may be provided at call time to bypass the random key selection. Keys passed in this way must exactly match a key in the Matrix.

By default, FlexCat will use key_bias="front_linear" and val_bias="truffle_shuffle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and it will truffle shuffle the sequence values. This config is known as TopCat, it produces a descending-step, micro-shuffled distribution sequence. Many other combinations are available.

### Random Index, ZeroCool Specification
ZeroCool Methods are used to generate random Sequence indices.

ZeroCool methods must have the following properties:
- Any distribution model is acceptable.
- The method or function must take exactly one Integer parameter N.
- The method returns a random int in range `[0, N)` for positive values of N.
- The method returns a random int in range `[N, 0)` for negative values of N.
- This symmetry matches how python can index a list from the back for negative index values or from the front for positive index values.


```python
from Fortuna import random_index


some_list = [i for i in range(100)]

print(some_list[random_index(10)])  # prints one of the first 10 items of some_list, [0, 9]
print(some_list[random_index(-10)])  # prints one of the last 10 items of some_list, [90, 99]
```

### Random Float Generators
`Fortuna.canonical() -> float`
- @return :: random float in range [0.0, 1.0), flat uniform.


`Fortuna.random_float(a: Float, b: Float) -> Float`
- @param a :: Float
- @param b :: Float
- @return :: random Float in range [a, b), flat uniform distribution.


`Fortuna.triangular(low Float, high Float, mode Float) -> Float`
- @param low :: Float, minimum output
- @param high :: Float, maximum output
- @param mode :: Float, most common output, mode must be in range `[low, high]`
- @return :: random number in range `[low, high]` with a linear distribution about the mode.


### Random Truth Generator
`Fortuna.percent_true(truth_factor: Float = 50.0) -> bool`
- @param truth_factor :: The probability of True as a percentage. Default is 50 percent.
- @return :: Produces True or False based on the truth_factor.
    - Always returns False if num is 0 or less
    - Always returns True if num is 100 or more.


### Shuffle Algorithms
`Fortuna.shuffle(array: list) -> None`
- Knuth B shuffle algorithm. Destructive, in-place shuffle.
- @param array :: Must be a mutable list-like object.

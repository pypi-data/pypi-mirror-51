Description: BinSeqs - Support for binary sequence formats in Bioython
        =========================================================
        
        BinSeqs is a Python package intended to enrich the SeqIO
        framework from [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) by adding
        support for some binary sequence formats.
        
        
        Deprecation Warning
        -------------------
        
        This code has now been merged into Biopython. Starting from
        Biopython release 1.75, all you need to do to support the formats
        below is to load the `Bio.SeqIO` module.
        
        Consequently, this project will no longer be maintained. It will
        remain available online but will not be updated. All improvements
        and bug fixes will occur in the Biopython repository.
        
        You can still use this module until Biopython 1.75 is released and
        available on your system. After that, loading the `incenp.bio.seqio`
        module will be a no-op and a DeprecationWarning will be emitted.
        
        
        Formats supported
        -----------------
        
        * `xdna` format, used by _DNA Strider_ and
          [Serial Cloner](http://serialbasics.free.fr/Serial_Cloner.html):
          reading and writing supported
        * `snapgene` format, used by [SnapGene](https://www.snapgene.com/):
          reading support only
        * `gck` format, used by [Gene Construction Kit](http://www.textco.com/gene-construction-kit.php):
          reading support only
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        The BinSeqs parsers and writers are not designed to be used
        independently and should instead be used through the Biopython's
        SeqIO module.
        
        Simply import the `incenp.bio.seqio` module to make the parsers
        and writers available to Biopython's SeqIO:
        
            from Bio import SeqIO
            import incenp.bio.seqio
        
            records = list(SeqIO.parse('snapgene_file.dna', 'snapgene'))
            SeqIO.write(records, 'serialcloner_file.xdna', 'xdna')

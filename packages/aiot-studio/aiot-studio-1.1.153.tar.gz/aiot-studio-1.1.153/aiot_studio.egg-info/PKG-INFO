Description: # AIoT Studio 
        
        AIoT Studio is the official library to develop datasources, notebooks and dependency sets for [mnubo's AIoT Studio.](https://smartobjects.mnubo.com/documentation/aiotStudio.html)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Requirements
        * Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 and up
        * `requests`
        * `pandas` â‰¥ 0.20
        * `numpy`
        
        `$ pip install aiot-studio`
        
        ## Simple datasource usage
        
        ```python
        from aiotstudio.search import to_pandas
        from aiotstudio.logging import log
        
        def execute(parameters):
            log.info("Hello aiot-studio")
                     
            result = to_pandas({
                "from": "event",
                "select": [{"count": "*"}]
            })
            return result
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        The library needs to be configured with your [mnubo API credentials](https://smartobjects.mnubo.com/documentation/api_security.html). 
        The credentials can be shared as follows (by decreasing order of priority):
        
        - Environment variables: `MNUBO_CLIENT_ID`, `MNUBO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MNUBO_API_URL`
        - Local config file: `application.conf` at the root of the project or anywhere indicated by the `MNUBO_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable
        - Global config file: `~/.settings/mnubo/application.conf` (or `C:\Users\<username>\.settings\mnubo\application.conf` on Windows)
        
        For the last two options, the configuration file should look like this:
        
        ```
        [DEFAULT]
        mnubo_client_id = {API_CLIENT_ID}
        mnubo_client_secret = {API_CLIENT_SECRET}
        mnubo_api_url = https://prod.api.mnubo.com
        ``` 
        
        
        ## Available package
        
          - `search`
          - `blobstore`
          - `logging`
        
        _Notes_:
          - All "search" methods expect a MQL query as described in the [search API](https://smartobjects.mnubo.com/documentation/api_search.html) documentation 
          - Blob store methods are only available when the code runs inside mnubo's architecture, using it locally would throw a `FeatureUnavailableError`

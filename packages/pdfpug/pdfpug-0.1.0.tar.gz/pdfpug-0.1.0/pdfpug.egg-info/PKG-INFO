Description: # Python PDF Generator
        
        **PdfPug** is a simple Python PDF creator using easy to use APIs. It provides a variety
        of components and the ability to customise these components to suit different use cases.
        
        **Note: PdfPug is still very new and as such the APIs are not stable. It can be
        considered to be in pre-alpha stage!**
        
        ## Installation
        
        ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
        $ pip install pdfpug
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ``` {.sourceCode .python}
        >>> from pdfpug import Header, Paragraph, PdfReport
        >>> intro_header = Header('Introduction to PdfPug')
        >>> para = Paragraph(
        ...     "Lorem Ipsum is <b>simply</b> <u>dummy</u> text of the printing and typesetting "
        ...     "industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text "
        ...     "ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type"
        ...     " and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not "
        ...     "only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, "
        ...     "remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with "
        ...     "the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and "
        ...     "more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker "
        ...     "including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
        ... )
        >>> report = PdfReport()
        >>> report.add_element(intro_header)
        >>> report.add_element(para)
        >>> report.generate_pdf('pdfpug-report.pdf')
        ```

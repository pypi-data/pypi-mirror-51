# ClowdFlows NLP Module #


A [ClowdFlows](https://github.com/xflows/clowdflows/) package, which contains widgets for natural language processing. The package can also be used with [ClowdFlows](https://github.com/xflows/clowdflows/) 2.0.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rdm/badge/?version=latest)](http://clowdflows.readthedocs.io/)

Currently, the project contains components for different corpus operations, basic natural language processing operations such as tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, etc. It also has modules for tweet streaming, term extraction and gender classification.


## Installation, documentation ##

Since three pickled models are too big for github, you have to download the following models manually from external links and add them to the cf_nlp/models/reldi_tagger subfolder in order to make Reldi tagger and Reldi lemmatizer work:

* http://nlp.ffzg.hr/data/reldi/hr.lexicon.guesser
* http://nlp.ffzg.hr/data/reldi/sr.lexicon.guesser
* http://nlp.ffzg.hr/data/reldi/sl.lexicon.guesser

Please note that because of package size limits the pypi packgage does not include the models, which needs to be added manually. This can be done by downloading the model folder from github (https://github.com/xflows/cf_nlp/tree/master/nlp/models). The three pickled models mentioned above need to be downloaded manually and added to the folder. You can also download a wheel with all the models inside from:

* http://kt.ijs.si/matej_martinc/cf_nlp-0.0.16-py2-none-any.whl

Please find other installation instructions, examples and API reference on [Read the Docs](http://clowdflows.readthedocs.io/).

## Note ##

Please note that this is a research project and that drastic changes can be (and are) made pretty regularly. Changes are documented in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

Pull requests and issues are welcome.

# python_forex_types
Class models for Eight major Forex Currency Pairs.

### Brief Description
This is not an API to any forex data. Instead it is a set of classes that I have found myself using in multiple different forex related applications that represent things like currency pairs, curriencies, prices and so forth, plus some basic functionality inside and between them, such as expressing difference of prices in pips and calculating the profit/loss of a trade and so forth.

### CAVEATS
1) Ony the eight major currencies are supported, namely the AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY, NZD and USD. From these there are 28 currency pairs. If you are looking to trade more exotic currencies or cyber-currencies, this package is the wrong one.
2) This is not anywhere near production grade (it doesn't even have unittesting yet). It is a side project which I do not have a lot of time to work on, and it is not likely to be well supported in the foreseeable future.

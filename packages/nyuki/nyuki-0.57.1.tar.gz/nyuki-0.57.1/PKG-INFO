Description: ! This package is not maintained anymore and the last version is 0.57.1 !
        
        A lightweight library designed to build nyukis (Python 3.6 only!). It provides features that shall help developers with managing the following topics while developing a nyuki:
        
        * Expose features through the own nyuki RESTful API
        * Communication between nyukis (over HTTP and MQTT)
        * Helpers for asyncio-based programming
        
        This library has been written with a focus on reliability and developer-friendliness. Its design promotes single-threaded and asynchronous coding style through the extensive use of the [Python asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) event loop. A single loop is used to manage HTTP and MQTT-based communications as well as executing internal logic.

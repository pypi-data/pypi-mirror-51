ctypesgen reads parses c header files and creates a wrapper for libraries base on what it finds.  Preprocessor macros are handled in a manner consistent with typical c code.  Preprocessor macro functions are translated into Python functions that are then made available to the user of the newly-generated Python wrapper library.
ctypesgen can also output JSON, which can be used with Mork, which generates bindings for Lua, using the alien module (which binds libffi to Lua).

        ### Detector
        
        #### Using CPU
        
        For running on CPU, YOLO weights (`.weights` file) have to be on `detection/detectors/yolo3_opencv/yolo-coco` , the file is available on  
        https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ukxp50S3pl97VNI3xT0IYS6OqwoeNOPu .
        
        #### Using GPU
        
        For running on GPU YOLO weights (`.h5` file) have to be on `detection/detectors/yolo3_keras/model_data` , the file is available on  
        https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WvnNVgwuB5muxkitcw4beSNL6najmqfE .

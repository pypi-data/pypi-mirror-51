    """
        This function convert the intan ata into the .mda format that MountainSort requires.

        Example:
            bin_filename = 'C:\\example\\bin_example.bin'
            set_filename = 'C:\\example\\bin_example.set'
            bin2mda(bin_filename, set_filename)

        Args:
            bin_filename (str): full filename for the .bin file that you want to convert to .mda
            desired_Fs (int): the sampling rate that you want the data to be at. I've added this because we generally record at 24k but
                we will convert to a 48k signal (the system we analyze w/ needs 48k).
            directory (string): the path of the directory the session and tetrode files are in.
            basename (string): the basename of the session you are converting.
            pre_threshold (int): the number of samples before the threshold that you want to save in the waveform
            post_threshold (int): the number of samples after the threshold that you want to save in the waveform
            self (object): self is the main window of a GUI that has a LogAppend method that will append this message to
                a log (QTextEdit), and a custom signal named myGUI_signal_str that would was hooked up to LogAppend to
                append messages to the log.
        Returns:
            mdas_written (list): a list of mda files that were created

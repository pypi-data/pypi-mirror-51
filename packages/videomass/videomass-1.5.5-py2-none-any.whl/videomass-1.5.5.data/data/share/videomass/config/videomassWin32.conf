# !! WARNING !!, LOGLEVEL OPTION:

# both information messages and error messages. Videomass does its best to

# 'loglevel error' option.
# Changing the followings loglevel, Videomass would not work correctly.
# FFmpeg and FFplay loglevel must be set to 'error'.

# progress bar and the percentage progress label. Note that in some cases 
# the -stats option is excluded when a process reading is not required.

# NOTE FOR EXECUTABLES BINARY:
# Videomass support custom executables links of FFmpeg, FFprobe and FFplay 
# binaries. These links refer to paths managed by users who want to use 
# other versions of FFmpeg in their user-space. If these options are not 
# used, videomass will use executables installed in the system by default

DESCRIPTION
===========

Automated Deployment of Lab Environments System (ADLES)

| ADLES automates the deterministic creation of virtualized environments for use in
  Cybersecurity and Information Technology (IT) education.
| The system enables educators to easily build deterministic and
  portable environments for their courses, saving significant amounts of
  time and effort, and alieviates the requirement of possessing advanced IT knowledge.

USAGE
=====

Creating an environment using ADLES:

* Read the exercise and infrastructure specifications and examples of them.
* Write an infrastructure specification for your platform. (Currently, VMware vSphere is the only platform supported)
* Write an exercise specification with the environment you want created.
* Check its syntax, run the mastering phase, make your changes, and then run the deployment phase.

The system began as a proof of concept implementation of my Master's thesis research at the
University of Idaho in Fall of 2016. It was originally designed to run on the RADICL lab.

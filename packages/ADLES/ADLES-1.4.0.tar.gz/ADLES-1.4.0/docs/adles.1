.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Automated Deployment of Lab Environments System (ADLES)
.nf
ADLES automates the deterministic creation of virtualized environments for use in
Cybersecurity and Information Technology (IT) education.
The system enables educators to easily build deterministic and
portable environments for their courses, saving significant amounts of
time and effort, and alieviates the requirement of possessing advanced IT knowledge.

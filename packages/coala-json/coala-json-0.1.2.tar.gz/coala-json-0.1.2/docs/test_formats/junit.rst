JUnit
=====

JUnit is the most popular test result report format which is used almost
everywhere. You can export code review result data to a file in JUnit XML
format easily. Jenkins, CircleCI, AppVeyor and many more analyse this
format directly and can convert the report into useful artifacts. You might
want to have a look at `Jenkins's JUnit graph <https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JUnit+graph>`_.

Sample JUnit file:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <testsuites>
    <testsuite package="PyLintBear" timestamp="2019-06-10T18:26:01.801875" tests="9" errors="9" name="/home/developer/coala-json/coala_json/TestOutput.py">
    <testcase name="PyLintBear C0111">
    <error message="line: 1, Column: 1, C0111 - Missing module docstring"></error>
    </testcase>
    </testsuite>
    </testsuites>

How to upload JUnit to CircleCI:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see test results as artifacts, you can add these to lines in your config
file.

``- store_test_results:``
    ``path: test-results``

Where the path key is an absolute or relative path to your working_directory
containing subdirectories of JUnit XML test metadata files. Make sure that
your path value is not a hidden folder (example: .my_hidden_directory would
be an invalid format).
After configuring CircleCI to collect your test metadata, tests that fail
most often appear in a list on the details page of Insights in the
application to identify flaky tests and isolate recurring issues.

How to upload JUnit to AppVeyor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test results endpoint URL has the following format:
``https://ci.appveyor.com/api/testresults/{resultsType}/{jobId}``

where:
resultsType - test framework name to parse test results; supported parsers:

- mstest
- xunit
- nunit
- nunit3
- junit.

jobId - build job ID that is currently running; can be read from
APPVEYOR_JOB_ID environment variable.
Example build script in PowerShell that uploads Junit tests results in XML format:

::

    # upload results to AppVeyor
    $wc = New-Object 'System.Net.WebClient'
    $wc.UploadFile("https://ci.appveyor.com/api/testresults/junit/$(($env:APPVEYOR_JOB_ID)",
                   (Resolve-Path .\junit-results.xml))

How to upload JUnit to Jenkins:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The JUnit plugin provides a publisher that consumes XML test reports generated
during the builds and provides some graphical visualization of the historical
test results as well as a web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures,
and so on. Jenkins understands the JUnit test report XML format (which is also
used by TestNG).

To use the plugin, from your Jenkins dashboard go to Manage Jenkins ->
Manage Plugins and then you can easily install it by searching the plugin in
the *available* plugins tab. The JUnit publisher is configured at the job level
by adding a Publish JUnit test result report post build action.
The configuration parameters include:

- **Test report XMLs:** Specify the path to JUnit XML files in the Ant glob
  syntax, such as ``**/build/test-reports/*.xml``. Be sure not to include any
  non-report files into this pattern. You can specify multiple patterns of
  files separated by commas. The base directory of the fileset is the workspace
  root.
- **Retain long standard output/error:** If checked, any standard output or
  error from a test suite will be retained in the test results after the build
  completes. (This refers only to additional messages printed to console, not
  to a failure stack trace). Such output is always kept if the test failed,
  but by default lengthy output from passing tests is truncated to save space.
  Check this option if you need to see every log message from even passing
  tests, but beware that Jenkinsâ€™s memory consumption can substantially
  increase as a result, even if you never look at the test results!
- **Health report amplification factor:** The amplification factor to apply to
  test failures when computing the test result contribution to the build health
  score. The default factor is 1.0. A factor of 0.0 will disable the test
  result contribution to build health score, and, as an example, a factor of
  0.5 means that 10% of tests failing will score 95% health. The factor is
  persisted with the build results, so changes will only be reflected in new
  builds.
- **Allow empty results:** If checked, the default behavior of failing a build
  on missing test result files or empty test results is changed to not affect
  the status of the build. Please note that this setting make it harder to spot
  misconfigured jobs or build failures where the test tool does not exit with
  an error code when not producing test report files.

If everything works out a 'Test Results' field will appear on your
Jenkins build panel. The report might look something like this:

Further pytest support
----------------------

Maybe handle config.option.tbstyle == "line" and others.

Add option to detect failures but not fail the pytest run, similar to xfail,
using the existing report.wasxfail, and some fiddling of the test status
using the following hints:

# def pytest_report_teststatus(report, config):
#     if not hasattr(report, 'pact_interaction'):
#         return
#
#     if hasattr(report, "wasxfail"):
#         if report.skipped:
#             return "xfailed", "x", "XFAIL"
#         elif report.passed:
#             return "xpassed", "X", "XPASS"
#     if report.passed:
#         letter = "."
#     elif report.skipped:
#         letter = "s"
#     elif report.failed:
#         letter = "F"
#         if report.when != "call":
#             letter = "f"
#     return report.outcome, letter, report.outcome.upper()

Continue from that to implement the "pending" pact feature.

Description: Python Mini Project
        A fully programmable user-land ecosystem purely on Python for deployment on IoT boards like RaspberryPi and BeagleBone.
        
        Usage
        We implemented the rudimentary skeleton shell that can be extended easily with new commands and functionality with minimal effort by a developer. The shell supports user-friendly command-line interface and also has a command history support that could be recalled across invocations.

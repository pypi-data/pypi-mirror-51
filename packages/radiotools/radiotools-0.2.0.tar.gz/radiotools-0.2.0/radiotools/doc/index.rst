default coordinate system and units
-----------------------------------
    The radiotools package uses the 'Auger' coordinate system: A zenith angle of 0 deg indicated the zenith and a zenith angle of 90 deg points towards the horizon. The azimuth angle counts from East counterclockwise, e.g., phi = 270 deg equals South. 

    Unless explicitly specified in a function, the following default units are used:
     * length: meter
     * time: second
     * energy: eV
     * angle: radian
     * mass: grams

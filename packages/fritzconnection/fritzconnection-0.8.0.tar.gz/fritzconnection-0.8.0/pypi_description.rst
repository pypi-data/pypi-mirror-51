fritzconnection
===============

Python-Tool to communicate with the AVM FritzBox.
Uses the TR-064 protocol.

Installation:
-------------

    pip install fritzconnection

Dependencies
------------

fritzconnection requires the python modules ``lxml`` and ``requests``:

    pip install lxml requests

Available Modules, Commands and Tools
-------------------------------------

``fritzconnection.py`` makes the SOAP interface of the FRITZ!Box available on the command line.
Shows all available services and actions when run with the argument ``-c``. Use ``-h`` for help.

This is the main module and works standalone. The other modules listet here are utility modules for convenience and examples on how to use fritzconnection.

``fritzstatus.py`` is a command line interface to display status information of the FRITZ!Box.
It also serves as an example on how to use the fritzconnection module.

``fritzmonitor.py`` is a Tkinter GUI to display current IP as well as the upstream and downstream rates.
It also makes it easy to reconnect and thus get a different IP from your ISP.

``fritzhosts.py`` is a command line interface to display the hosts known by the FRITZ!Box with IP, name, MAC and status.

``fritzwlan.py`` Utility module for FritzConnection to list the known WLAN connections.

``fritzcallforwarding.py`` Utility module for FritzConnection to manage callforwardings.

``fritzphonebook.py`` Utility module for FritzConnection to access phone books.

``fritzcall.py`` Gives access to recent phone calls: incoming, outgoing and missed ones.


Other Files
-----------

``fritztools.py`` contains some helper functions and ``test.py`` contains unit tests.

Quickstart:
-----------

Inspect the API:

    >>> import fritzconnection as fc
    >>> fc.print_api(password='your_password')

An API-Call is made by the ``call_action``-method of the FritzConnection-Class. This method takes the ``servicename``, the ``actionname`` and optional arguments as parameter and may return a dictionary with the results (as described in the TR-064 protocoll description). A simple example is to reconnect for a new external ip:

    >>> from fritzconnection import FritzConnection
    >>> connection = FritzConnection()
    >>> connection.call_action('WANIPConnection', 'ForceTermination')
    # or more comfortable:
    >>> connection.reconnect()

The latter wrapps the ``call_action``-method. For a more complete example look at the ``fritzhosts.py`` souce-code.


Changed with version 0.8.0:
---------------------------

bugfix how servicenames are extracted from the xml-description files. However, the api has not changed.

The requirements are now fixed for lxml (4.3.4) and requests (2.22.0) as these versions are still supporting python 2.7

Changed with version 0.7.1 - 0.7.3:
-----------------------------------

bugfixes, no new features or other changes.

Changed with version 0.7.0:
---------------------------

FritzConnection does now check for the environment variables ``FRITZ_USER`` and ``FRITZ_PASSWORD`` in case that neither user nor password are given.

FritzStatus now accepts user and password as keyword-parameters. Keep in mind, that FritzBoxes may return different informations about the status depending whether these are gathered with or without a password.

Changed with version 0.6.5:
---------------------------

There is a new attribute *package_version*:

    >>> import fritzconnection
    >>> fritzconnection.package_version
    0.6.5

Because every module of the fritzconnection-package has it's own version, version-history of the package gets confusing over time. From now on every change of the content of the package is indicated by the the package-version. Every unchanged module keeps it's version. So i.e. the recent package-version is 0.6.5 but the fritzconnection-module is still in version 0.6 cause nothing has changed in this module since then.

Changed with version 0.6:
-------------------------

FritzConnection now uses long qualified names as ``servicename``, i.e. ``WLANConfiguration:1`` or ``WLANConfiguration:2``. So these servicenames can now be used to call actions on different services with the same name:

    >>> connection = FritzConnection()
    >>> info = connection.call_action('WANIPConnection:2', 'GetInfo')

For backward compatibility servicename-extensions like ':2' can be omitted on calling 'call_action'. In this case FritzConnection will use the extension ':1' as default.

On calling unknown services or actions in both cases KeyErrors has been raised. Calling an unknown service (or one unaccessible without a password) will now raise a ``ServiceError``. Calling an invalid action on a service will raise an ``ActionError``. Both Exceptions are Subclasses from the new ``FritzConnectionException``. The Exception classes can get imported from fritzconnection:

    >>> from fritzconnection import ServiceError, ActionError

This is release 0.2.11 of ncbi-genome-download which fixes two logging issues.

Thanks to David Morgan (@Cptmorgan27) for providing a patch.

Detailed changes:

David Morgan (1):
      core: remove print statement for type material

Kai Blin (4):
      chore: Use a named logger instead of the root logger
      README: Make it clearer that more than just bacteria and viral groups are available
      chore: Remove landscape.io link, as that service seems dead
      Bump version number to 0.2.11

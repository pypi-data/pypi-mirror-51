Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.app.changeownership as it sounds is a Plone package to change objects
        ownership.
        
        Problem
        =======
        
        While for a single content you can call the ``/change-owner`` view,
        there is no way in Plone to transfer **ownership of all objects** owned by an user
        to a new user. To delete a Plone member in such case is not an option. 
        
        Solution
        ========
        
        plone.app.changeownership makes easy to transfer ownership from one ore more 
        members to a new member. It also can change content metadata, like *Creators*
        field.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        The addon is installed via your Plone buildout.
        
        * Add ``plone.app.changeownership`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.: ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                plone.app.changeownership
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with: ::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You have to install the package from quickinstaller or setup_tool. You will get
        a configlet in the Plone control panel named "Change Ownership".

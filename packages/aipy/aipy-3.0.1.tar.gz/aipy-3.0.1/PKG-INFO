Description: This package collects together tools for radio astronomical interferometry. In addition to pure-python phasing, calibration, imaging, and deconvolution code, this package includes interfaces to MIRIAD (a Fortran interferometry package) and HEALPix (a package for representing spherical data sets). Instructions, documentation, and a FAQ may be found at [the aipy GitHub page](http://github.com/HERA-Team/aipy).

        A mod installer and manager for BoTW mods on Cemu
        
        ## Dependencies

        * Python 3.7 (64-bit, added to system PATH)
        
        The following `pip` packages, which will be automatically installed:
        * [`aamp`](https://pypi.org/project/aamp/)
        * [`byml`](https://pypi.org/project/byml/)
        * [`diff-match-patch`](https://pypi.org/project/diff-match-patch/)
        * [`PySide2`](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)
        * [`pyYaml`](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)

        * [`wszst_yaz0`](https://pypi.org/project/wszst-yaz0/)
        * [`xxhash`](https://pypi.org/project/xxhash/)
        
        ## Setup
        
        First, make sure you have Python 3.7 64 bit installed and in your system PATH. For more information about this, you can view this
        
        BCML is available through Python's `pip` installer, so just run: `pip install bcml`
        
        Alternatively, you can clone the repository, and then run `python setup.py install` from the BCML root folder.
        
        On first use, you will have to specify the directory to which Cemu is installed.
        
        **Notice:** While it is certainly possible to use BCML for some mods and install others manually, no compatibility is guaranteed. It is recommended to uninstall all Cemu mods before using BCML, and then to reinstall them through BCML.
        
        ## Supported Mods
        
        - Mods must be packed as ZIP, 7z, or  RAR archives.
        - Only mods with a `rules.txt` file for Cemu graphics pack file replacement are suppported. If you want to convert an older mod, you might find help from [this guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/12493).
        
        ## GUI Usage
        
        As of version 0.98, BCML now includes a graphical user interface. Hopefully this is simpler for everyone. You can run the graphical BCML simply by:
        
        ```
        bcml-gui
        ```
        
        You can also create a shortcut on your desktop if you wish. The path to the executable is will be in the "Scripts" folder in your Python installation (e.g. `C:\Python37\Scripts\bcml-gui.exe`), and an icon is included in the data folder where the BCML package is installed (e.g. `C:\Python37\Lib\site-packages\bcml\data\bcml.ico`).
        
        The interface is previewed below and seems fairly self-explanatory. If you need more details, check the detailed reference for the CLI version below.

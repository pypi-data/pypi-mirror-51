Description: Case Recommender - A Python Framework for RecSys
        ===================================================
        
        Case Recommender is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and
        explicit feedback.  The framework aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized
        recommender system from a set of algorithms. Case Recommender has different types of item recommendation and rating
        prediction approaches, and different metrics validation and evaluation.
        
        Algorithms
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Item Recommendation:
        
        - BPRMF
        
        - ItemKNN
        
        - Item Attribute KNN
        
        - UserKNN
        
        - User Attribute KNN
        
        - Group-based (Clustering-based algorithm)
        
        - Paco Recommender (Co-Clustering-based algorithm)
        
        - Most Popular
        
        - Random
        
        - Content Based
        
        Rating Prediction:
        
        - Matrix Factorization (with and without baseline)
        
        - SVD
        
        - Non-negative Matrix Factorization
        
        - SVD++
        
        - ItemKNN
        
        - Item Attribute KNN
        
        - UserKNN
        
        - User Attribute KNN
        
        - Item NSVD1 (with and without Batch)
        
        - User NSVD1 (with and without Batch)
        
        - Most Popular
        
        - Random
        
        - gSVD++
        
        - Item-MSMF
        
        - (E)CoRec
        
        Clustering:
        
        - PaCo: EntroPy Anomalies in Co-Clustering
        
        - k-medoids
        
        Evaluation and Validation Metrics
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - All-but-one Protocol
        
        - Cross-fold- Validation
        
        - Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall, NDCG and Map
        
        - Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE
        
        - Statistical Analysis (T-test and Wilcoxon)
        
        Requirements
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Python >= 3
        - scipy
        - numpy
        - pandas
        - scikit-learn
        
        For Linux, Windows and MAC use:
        
            $ pip install requirements

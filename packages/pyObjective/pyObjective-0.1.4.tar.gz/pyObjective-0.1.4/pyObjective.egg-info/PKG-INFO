Description: # pyObjective
        
        This is a simple package where you can optimize a complicated structure by simply creating the variables as you go, and passing the object to scipy.optimize when necessary.
        
        As such, it removes the need to form a careful optimization function or to worry about which index of the vector refers to which variable. All of these details are abstracted away.

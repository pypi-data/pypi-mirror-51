TODO: (in no particular order)

	- renames for various modules
	- text color changes
	- directory updates

 - should validate against api's schema - would be better to have documentation for this
 - SSL
 - file permissions
 - continue to clean naming as we go
 - support yaml or json definition files for API calls?
 - build out cruft-catcher
 - README
 - create a method to add the gitlab user if not exists?  or at least the build can check and throw a coherent error
 if this happens.

 - change text color for test/validation output
 - update directory to reflect reality/allow users to configure where their stuff is
 

TODO testing:
- invalid json
- improper file or check naming
- nonexistent or invalid directory
- API health check fail
- API authentication fail
- rsync:
   - improper permissions
   - empty directory
   - remove file
   - file/directory does not exist
- misconfiguration of various sorts
- network latency/inability to connect to API/timeout

From assets.py:
        # throw an exception if the file is empty

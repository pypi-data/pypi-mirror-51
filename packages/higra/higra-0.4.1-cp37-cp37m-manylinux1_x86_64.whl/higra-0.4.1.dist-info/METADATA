Higra is a C++/Python library for efficient sparse graph analysis with a special focus on hierarchical methods. Some of the main features are:

- efficient methods and data structures to handle the dual representations of hierarchical clustering: trees (dendrograms) and saliency maps (ultrametric distances);
- hierarchical clusterings: quasi-flat zone hierarchy, hierarchical watersheds, agglomerative clustering (single-linkage, average-linkage, complete-linkage, exponential-linkage, Ward, or custom rule), constrained connectivity hierarchy;
- component trees: min and max trees;
- manipulate and explore hierarchies:  simplification, accumulators, cluster extraction, various attributes (size, volume, dynamics, perimeter, compactness, moments, etc.), horizontal and non-horizontal cuts, hierarchies alignment;
- optimization on hierarchies: optimal cuts, energy hierarchies;
- algorithms on graphs: accumulators, vertices and clusters dissimilarities, region adjacency graphs, minimum spanning trees and forests, watershed cuts;
- assessment: supervised assessment of graph clusterings and hierarchical clusterings;
- image toolbox: special methods for grid graphs, tree of shapes, hierarchical clustering methods dedicated to image analysis, optimization of Mumford-Shah energy.

Higra is thought for modularity, performance and seamless integration with classical data analysis pipelines. The data structures (graphs and trees) are decoupled from data (vertex and edge weights ) which are simply arrays ([xtensor](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor) arrays in C++ and [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) arrays in Python).

## Installation

### Python

The Python package can be installed with Pypi:

```bash
pip install higra
```

Supported systems: 

 - Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
 - Linux 64 bits, macOS, Windows 64 bits

### C++ backend

The C++ backend is an header only library. No facilities for system wide installation is currently provided: just copy/past where you need it!

## Documentation

[https://higra.readthedocs.io/](https://higra.readthedocs.io/)

## Demonstration and tutorials

Check the dedicated repository [Higra-Notebooks](https://github.com/higra/Higra-Notebooks) for a collection of Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to Higra.

## Build

### With cmake

Requires:

* cmake 
* Python + Numpy

Commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/higra/Higra.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../Higra/
make
```

Sometimes, cmake gets confused when several Python versions are installed on the system.
You can specify which version to use with `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/PATH-TO-PYTHON/python`, e.g.

```
cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/anaconda3/bin/python ../Higra/
```

The python package is build in the directory

```
build/higra/
```

### With setup.py

The file `setup.py` is a thin wrapper around the `cmake` script to provide compatibility with python `setuptools`. 

```
pip install cmake
python setup.py bdist_wheel
cd dist
pip install higra*.whl
```

## Developing extensions

While Higra provides many vectorized operators to implement algorithms efficiently in Python, it is possible that
some operations cannot be done efficiently in Python. 
In such case, the [Higra-cppextension-cookiecutter](https://github.com/higra/Higra-cppextension-cookiecutter) enables
to easily setup and generate c++ extension using Higra with Python bindings.

## Third-party libraries

Higra bundles several third-party libraries (inside the `lib` folder): 

- [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) helps to create Python bindings of c++ methods and classes - [BSD-style license](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/LICENSE)
- [xtensor](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor) (with [xtl](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtl), [xsimd](https://github.com/QuantStack/xsimd), and [xtensor-python](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor-python) provides `numpy` like arrays for c++ with seamless integration with Python - all under the [BSD-3-Clause license](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor/blob/master/LICENSE)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) is a unit test framework - [Boost Software License 1.0](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

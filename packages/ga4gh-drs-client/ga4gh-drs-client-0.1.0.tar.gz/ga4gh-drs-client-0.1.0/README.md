# ga4gh-drs-client

The GA4GH DRS Client is a Python-based command-line application for requesting
omics data and metadata from web services that are compliant with the [Data Repository Service (DRS) API Specification](https://github.com/ga4gh/data-repository-service-schemas). The DRS API specification, developed
by the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/), serves to provide a standardized
API framework to allow for interoperability of datasets hosted at different
institutions.

Please review the [GA4GH DRS Client Documentation](https://ga4gh-drs-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for instructions on how to install and use the command-line application.

# DKIST Sphinx Theme

The DKIST documentation theme

In your sphinx `conf.py` file you will need to put something similar to the following:

```python
from dkist_sphinx_theme.conf import html_theme_path, html_theme, html_theme_options
```

This theme is based on the theme of the [Sheffield HPC documentation
site](http://docs.hpc.sheffield.ac.uk/).

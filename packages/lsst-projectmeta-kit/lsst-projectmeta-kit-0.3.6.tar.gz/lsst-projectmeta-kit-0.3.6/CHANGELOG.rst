0.3.6 (2019-08-26)
==================

- Add TSTN and OPSTN document handles.

0.3.5 (2019-04-02)
==================

- Fixed a bug where the ``lsstdoc`` author parsing would split names like "Amanda."
- Updated ``pytest`` to 4.4.0, ``pytest-flake8`` to 1.0.4, and ``pytest-cov`` to 2.6.1.

0.3.4 (2018-12-06)
==================

- Switched to `setuptools_scm <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools_scm/>`_ for establishing the package's version string.
  Previously lsst-projectmeta-kit used versioneer.

- Add PSTN and SITCOMTN document handles.

0.3.3 (2018-11-26)
==================

- Fix an issue with the ``input_include_pattern`` regular expression that detects ``\input`` and ``\include`` commands.
  It was detecting expressions like ``\newcommand{\inputData}[1]{\texttt{#1}}`` because both the whitespace and bracket delimiters to the argument were optional.
  Now at least whitespace or an opening bracket are required.

- Ensure that LaTeX-formatted strings in test code aren't being interpreted as improper escape sequences (pycodestyle's W605 error code).

0.3.2 (2018-02-13)
==================

- Fix a regular expression case sensitivity in ``lsstprojectmeta.git.urls.parse_repo_slug_from_url``.

0.3.1 (2018-02-10)
==================

- Fixes to the ``projectmeta-ingest-docs`` pipeline.
- Catch the ``RuntimeError`` when calling ``LsstLatexDoc.build_jsonld`` if pypandoc fails to convert the LaTeX source to plain text.
  We fall back to using the LaTeX source itself in those cases.

0.3.0 (2018-02-07)
==================

Changes
-------

- Rename repo to lsst-projectmeta-kit and rename the Python package to ``lsstprojectmeta``.
  It's always been a struggle to name this project, but we're seeing "projectmeta" as the overall label for this initiative to capture LSST project metadata from documentation and code.
  Thus the ``-kit`` suffix represents the toolkit for the wider lsst-projectmeta ecosystem of repositories.
- The ``metasrc-deparagraph`` command line executable is now called ``lsstprojectmeta-deparagraph`` because of the rename.

New
---

- Added an extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline for Sphinx-based LSST technotes and Lander-based landing page projects (that is, lsstdoc LaTeX documents).
  The ETL pipeline is available as the ``projectmeta-ingest-docs`` command line program.
  It uses the LSST the Docs (LTD) API to find technote projects, then for each technote gets a ``metadata.yaml`` file and additional data from the GitHub API.
  If the LTD product can't be treated as a technote project, then we treat it as a Lander-based site where a ``metadata.jsonld`` file exists at the site's root.
  The ETL pipeline merges this data in a JSON-LD document that is loaded into the LSST Projectmeta MongoDB service.
- New ``LsstLatexDoc.build_json()`` that can be used to export metadata about an lsstdoc-based document as JSON-LD.
  This method is intended for the `Lander <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lander>`_ project to upload metadata at build time.
- New ``lsstprojectmeta.github.graphql`` module that provides access to predefined GraphQL queries and executes them on the GitHub v4 (GraphQL) API.
- New ``lsstprojectmeta.ltd`` module that provides (asyncio) client functions for the LTD Keeper HTTP API.
- New ``lsstprojectmeta.lsstdocument.handles`` module that provides APIs for parsing LSST document handles and mapping handles to series titles.
- New ``lsstprojectmeta.jsonld`` module that provides custom JSON encoders and decoders.
  The main role of these APIs is to roundtrip Python's native ``datetime.datetime`` objects.
  This ensures we never have to work with string-based dates in Python code, and always serialize dates consistently as ISO 8601 in the UTC timezone.
- New dependencies on ``'motor>=1.2.0, <1.3.0'``.

0.2.2 (2017-11-20)
==================

- Constrain ``pypandoc.download_pandoc`` to specifically install Pandoc 1.19.1 rather than the latest Pandoc.
  We think that Pandoc 2.0+ may be incompatible with pypandoc 1.4's download function.
  See `DM-12569 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-12569>`_ for details.
- Update pytest to 3.2.5 and pytest-flake8 to 0.9.1 to solve incompatibilities in the floating indirect dependencies.

0.2.1 (2017-10-09)
==================

- Add a ``LsstLatexDoc.revision_datetime`` attribute to access the latest revision date metadata of a LaTeX document.
  This property uses a set value in the ``\date`` command, if available.
  Otherwise it falls back to the timestamp of the most recent Git commit that affected content (files with ``tex``, ``bib``, ``pdf``, ``png``, and ``jpg`` extensions).
  The final fallback is the current time.
  The ``LsstLatexDoc.revision_datetime_source`` attribute describes how the date was computed: ``tex``, ``git``, or ``now``.
- New ``metasrc.git.timestamp`` module for accessing commit dates from a local Git repository.
- New dependency on ``pytz``.
- New dependency on ``GitPython``.

0.2.0 (2017-09-28)
==================

The 0.2.0 release brings Pandoc integration for better conversions from LaTeX to HTML and plain text.

Changes
-------

- Renamed ``metasrc.tex.lsstdoc.LsstDoc`` to ``metasrc.tex.lsstdoc.LsstLatexDoc``.
- Renamed ``metasrc.tex.texnormalizer`` to ``metasrc.tex.normalizer``.
- We now assign a ``NullHandler`` to metasrc's root logger.
  This makes it easier for you to add your own handlers and control metasrc's logging.

New
---

- New dependencies on ``pypandoc>=1.4``, ``panflute==1.10.6``, ``aiohttp>=2.25``, and ``pybtex>=0.21``.

- New ``metasrc.pandoc`` namespace for working with Pandoc:

  - ``metasrc.pandoc.convert.convert_text()`` and ``convert_lsstdoc_tex()`` wraps pypandoc's ``convert_text()`` function and provides extra conveniences, like running with the ``metasrc-deparagraph`` filter and ensuring that pandoc is installed.
  - ``metasrc.pandoc.convert.ensure_pandoc()`` is a decorator that ensures Pandoc is installed before running the wrapped function.
    If necessary, it uses pypandoc to install Pandoc.
  - The ``metasrc-deparagraph`` CL program is a Pandoc filter, made with panflute, that removes the paragraph tags around a single paragraph of text.
    This is useful when extracting single paragraphs or sentences (such as titles or authors).

- New functionality in ``metasrc.tex.lsstdoc.LsstLatexDoc`` that improves the quality of LaTeX to HTML5 conversions:

  - ``LsstLatexDoc`` now lazily parses an lsstdoc LaTeX document.
    Content is extracted or processed when attributes are accessed.
  - ``LsstLatexDoc.read()`` class method for reading LaTeX source, normalizing it, and creating an ``LsstLatexDoc`` instance.
  - New ``html_*`` and ``plain_*`` attributes with content converted to the given format.
    For example, ``html_abstract`` is the abstract converted to HTML5 with Pandoc.
    The regular attributes, ``title``, ``abstract``, and ``authors`` provide the original LaTeX.
  - The ``LsstLatexDoc.bib_db`` attributes provides a ``pybtex.database.BibliographyData`` instance with all BibTeX bibliography referenced by the document.
  - The ``html_abstract`` and ``plain_abstract`` attributes pre-process the LaTeX snippet before converting with Pandoc.
    The only pre-processing step implemented so far is the citation linker, which replaces ``\cite*`` commands with hyperlinks (``\href``).
    This decouples the LaTeX snippet from the BibTeX database.

- New ``metasrc.tex.lsstbib`` module:
  
  - The ``get_bibliography()`` function Lets you get a ``pybtex.database.BibliographyData`` instance that includes BibTeX from both local BibTeX files and the common lsst-texmf BibTeX files.
    ``aiohttp`` (``asyncio``) lets us download lsst-texmf BibTeX files quickly from the ``master`` branch on GitHub.
  - ``get_url_from_entry()`` makes it easier to get a URL to the entity described by a pybtex Entry.
    Works with DocuShare handles, ``adsurl``, DOIs, and plain ``url`` fields.
  - ``get_authoryear_from_entry()`` creates natbib-like in-text citations from a pybtex Entry.
    For example, "Sick et al (2017)."

- New ``metasrc.tex.citelink`` module.
  The ``CitationLinker`` class processes LaTeX source and replaces citation commands with hyperlinks to decouple a LaTeX snippet from a BibTeX database.
  This is useful for Pandoc conversions to HTML.
  These commands are currently converted:

  - ``\citeds``
  - ``\citedsp``
  - ``\citep``

- Fixed warnings related to unintended escapes when using ``re.sub``.

0.1.4 (2017-09-07)
==================

- Add new ``metasrc.tex.commandparser.LatexCommand`` to extract argument content for LaTeX commands using stream parsing and bracket matching.
  This is an improvement on the regular expression matching used by ``LsstDoc`` that was brittle to multi-line commands. (`DM-11821 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-11821>`_)
- Port ``metasrc.tex.lsstdoc.LsstDoc`` to use ``LatexCommand`` (no external API changes).
- Port ``metasrc.tex.scraper.get_newcommand_macros`` to use ``LatexCommand`` (no external API changes).

0.1.3 (2017-07-12)
==================

- Add new ``metasrc.tex.texnormalizer.read_tex_file`` function that reads a tex file and inserts reference files into the source.
  Works with ``\input`` and ``\include`` commands.
- New support for macro resolution in TeX source.
  The ``metasrc.tex.scraper.get_macros`` to scrape TeX macro definitions from ``\def`` and ``\newcommand`` commands.
  The ``metasrc.tex.texnormalizer.replace_macros`` function takes the output from ``get_macros`` and replaces macros in TeX source with the macro content.
  Only static macros (those without arguments) are supported by these functions.
- Add ``LsstDoc.is_draft`` property.
  This property is ``True`` if the ``lsstdraft`` option is in the ``documentclass`` declaration.

0.1.2 (2017-06-17)
==================

- Add new ``metasrc.tex.texnormalizer`` module with ``remove_comments()` and ``remove_trailing_whitespace()`` functions.
  Projects can use these functions in a pipeline to clean TeX source to make subsequent parsing tasks easier.
  (`DM-10961 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-10961>`)

0.1.1 (2017-06-13)
==================

- Make regular expressions for parsing lsstdoc TeX documents more flexible with respect to internal whitespace (`DM-10920 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-10920>`_).

0.1.0 (2017-05-24)
==================

- Initial version.
- ``metasrc.github.auth`` module support GitHub authentication using their integrations API.
- ``metasrc.tex.lsstdoc`` supports data scraping from LSST LaTeX documents based on the ``lsstdoc`` class from `lsst-texmf`_.

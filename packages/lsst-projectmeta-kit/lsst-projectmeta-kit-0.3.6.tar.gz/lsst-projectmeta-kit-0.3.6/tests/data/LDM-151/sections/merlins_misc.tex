Miscellaneous algorithms:

Learning to interpret the 1kHz digitisation of the shutter position to turn that into an accurate exposure time. Naively one would think it needs to be good to 0.1\%, but a miscalulation in exposure time is identical (xxx someone check this) in effect to "grey extinction" and so would be fixed by an ubercal-like process. However, dealing with this probably (and hopefully falls on DM rather than TCS).




CBP scripting:

Coordinate transformations:
details what these are

Say that the actual control software is coming as part of the procurement of the instrument
(and check with Patrick that that is true!)

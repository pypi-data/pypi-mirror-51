I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.0.1

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

The main news in this release:

o Ported to Python 3
o Multiple interpreter support disabled.
o Classifier byclass removed. There are no more old style classes.
c Extended C integer size to work on 64 bit Windows machines.
o Many minor changes.

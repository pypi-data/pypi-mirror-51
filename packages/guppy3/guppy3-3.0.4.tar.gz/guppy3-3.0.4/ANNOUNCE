I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.0.4

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

The main news in this release:

o A error message is now displayed pointing to guppy-pe if the package is
  installed in Python 2, and a warning is now displayed if the package is
  installed in non-CPython.
o Profile Browser is now able to load data dumps and how to perform a dump
  is documented.

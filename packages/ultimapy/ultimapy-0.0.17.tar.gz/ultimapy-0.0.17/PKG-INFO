        ## ultimapy
        
        ultimapy is a python library for rendering images from the Ultima Online client files. The SDK part of the project is almost a direct 1:1 code translation of the C# Ultima SDK (used by UOFiddler, among other things).
        
        ### Features
        ultimapy can currently do the following:
        * Render land, statics. This includes rendering of in game items.
        * Render "animations" or single frames of animations. This includes monsters and players, though player construction is done by rendering the mount, body, hair and clothing layers in order.
        * Draw text from the client (eg, ASCIIFont).
        * Extract information about skills - naming, groups, indexes.
        
        ##### Unimplemented features
        ###### Planned
        * Rendering gumps
        * Rendering paperdolls (requires gumps)
        * Command to fully set up ultimapy - downloading compatible client files and auto generating your environment to make getting going on your website easy.
        
        ###### Unplanned
        * UOP support is not planned, which limits the client version.
        
        
        
        ### Installation
        Install ultimapy to your project with:
        
        `pip install ultimapy`
        
        You must specify your Ultima Online client directory by any of the following methods:
        
        * `environment.ini` - add the line `ULTIMA_FILES_DIR=/path/to/ultima `
        * Django - add into settings.py: `ULTIMA_FILES_DIR=/path/to/ultima`
        * Specify an environment variable `ULTIMA_FILES_DIR` with the value `/path/to/ultima`
        
        ### Settings
        As above, settings can be set through any of the methods that the `ULTIMA_FILES_DIR` can be set by (`environment.ini`, Django settings, environment variable).
        
        Currently there are only 2 settings:
        * `ULTIMA_FILES_DIR`, this is the path to your Ultima Online directory. This has no default and will not read from registry.
        * `ULTIMA_MOUNT_IDS`, if loaded via environment, should be a valid json list of all possible mount IDs. If set in Django, can simply be set up as a list. This has a default of mounts that are found in the 5.0.8.3 client.
        
        
        ### How to use ultimapy
        
        Example of creating an image:
        
        ```
        from ultimapy.ascii_font import ASCIIFont
        
        img = ASCIIFont.FONTS[3].get_string_image("Hello world")
        img.save("HelloWorld.bmp")
        
        from ultimapy.animations import Animation
        
        red = 32
        south = 1
        just_standing_there = 0
        only_give_me_the_first_frame = True
        # args don't need to be explicitly specified, but for the sake of an example...
        img_frame = Animation.get_animation(body=400, action=just_standing_there, direction=south, hue=red, first_frame=only_give_me_the_first_frame)
        img = img_frame[0].bitmap  # there will only be an index of 1 if you only ask for the first frame
        img.save("red_guy.bmp")
        ```

Description: 
        metaVis
        ========
        metaVis is a heatmap visualization tool that enables users to interactively interface with their data that centers around the inclusion of "metadata" 
        \- supplementary information behind each data point that characterizes and contextualizes it. 
        metaVis comprises two main components: a server and web portal that provides flexible data upload and the heatmap visualization tool itself in the form of a generated standalone html file. 
        The metaVis visualization tool is meant to enable scientists and researchers to more easily visualize their datasets, recontextualize and gain a wider perspective 
        of their data through the intergration of "metadata", and interactively perform exploratory data analysis.

# Starting the update server backgrounded and then immediately moving on to
# the api server can cause boot failures due to resource contention on the
# smoothieâ€™s serial port, since the update server tries to talk to the
# smoothie to get its firmware version. To fix this, we need to make the
# update server actually close out the smoothie connection so we can hook
# in some synch logic, but barring that we
# - set a magic env var in the update server so that when it imports the
#   api wheel, the api wheel knows to not do some long-lasting tasks at
#   import time, which lessons the time we need to-
# - sleep in between the update server and api server starting. Sorry.

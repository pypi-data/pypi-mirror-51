Soupstars makes it fast and easy to build web parsers in Python.

It supports python 3.7+

## Quickstart

Install it with pip.

```
pip install soupstars
```

Create a new parser using the `soupstars` command. The `create` command will use a template parser.

```
soupstars create -m myparser.py
```

Parsers are simple python modules.

```
cat myparser.py
```

Notice that the only set up required is the special `parse` decorator and a variable named `url` for the web page you want to parse.

```python
from soupstars import parse

url = "https://corbettanalytics.com/"

@parse
def h1(soup):
    return soup.h1.text
```

You can test that the parser functions correctly.

```
soupstars test -m myparser.py
```

The output is a json object.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "h1": "Level up your analytics"
    },
    "status": 200,
    "url": "https://corbettanalytics.com/",
    "errors": {}
}
```

More feature are available in the CLI. Type `soupstars --help` to see the list of commands

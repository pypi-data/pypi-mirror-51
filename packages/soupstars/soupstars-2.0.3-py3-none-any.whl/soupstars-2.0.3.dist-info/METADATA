Soupstars makes it fast and easy to build web parsers in Python.

It supports python 3.7+

## Quickstart

Install it with pip.

```
pip install soupstars
```

Create a new parser in the file `myparser.py`.

```
soupstars create -m myparser.py
```

Parsers are python modules that can be executed directly. For a tutorial on building your own see the [documentation](https://soupstars.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```
cat myparser.py
```

...


You can test that the parser functions correctly.

```
soupstars test myparser.py
```

More feature are available in the CLI.

```
soupstars --help
```

Additional help is available in the [documentation](https://soupstars.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Deploying to soupstars.cloud

You can deploy your parsers to be ran on our managed infrastructure.

Use the CLI to create an account. You'll be prompted for a username and password.

```
soupstars register
```

Upload your parser.

```
soupstars push myparser.py
```

You can now run the parser from our service.

```
soupstars run myparser.py
```

## Development

Clone this repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:tjwaterman99/soupstars.git &&
cd soupstars
```

Install the package in development mode.

```
python setup.py develop
```

To develop against a local install of the latest version of the web API,
download and run the `soupstars-api` package.

```
git clone ...
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

# Cutevariant

cutevariant is a light standalone viewer of genetic variation written in Python for Qt. It allows you to view and filter VCF and other format files.

![Cutevariant example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labsquare/CuteVariant-cpp/master/screencast.gif)

# Installation

    pip install cutevariant # install
    cutevariant             # run

# Installation on Windows

Pyside2 is not currently (2019 May) functional on Cygwin, so Cutevariant will not work on Cygwin.

- Install Python3.6+
- Install like the previous chapter said.
- Add the path of python scripts executables to your PATH variable; Something like:

``` C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\ ``` 

Two executables are generated in this directory:

    - cutevariant_win_dbg.exe: Open a console in background to see debugging messages.

    Note: Qt libs seems to have a very high loglevel and such a verbosity could make the program unusable.

    - cutevariant.exe: Standard executable.


## Developement in progress

Complete rewriting from Cpp to Python.

###  To get tests running

    git clone git@github.com:labsquare/cutevariant.git
    cd cutevariant
    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    make install_deps # install
    make install # pip install -e . 
    make run     # start application
    make test    # start tests


### Development & release cycle

Use [zest.releaser](https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io) to handle the version and distribution through pypi.

    pip install zest.releaser[recommended]

To yield a new release, use:

    fullrelease

### Development on Windows (good luck)

- Install Python3.6+
- Install git
- Install make (optional)

    pip install wheel
    git clone https://github.com/ysard/cutevariant.git
    git fetch
    git checkout dev # or devel
    make install # or pip install --user -e .[dev]

Executable files are located here:

- Executable path:
    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\cutevariant.exe


### Build standalone program/archive/blob[add synonyms here] on Windows using cx_freeze

Strongly discouraged: You will generate an archive of 350Mo just for a program of
less than 900Ko (including 550Ko of fonts and icons).

Install cx_freeze:

    pip install cx_freeze

Build a blob:

    make build_windows_blob

Your blob is in `./build/` directory.

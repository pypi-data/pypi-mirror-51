Description: # tf_object_detection
        
        This is a thin wrapper around [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) for easy installation and use. The original [installation procedure](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) contains multiple manual steps that make dependency management difficult. This repository creates a pip package that automate the installation so that you can install the API with a single pip install.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install tf-object-detection
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        All the scripts from tensorflow object detection APIs work out-of-box. 
        You can find an example usages from the API's [model_main.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/model_main.py).
        
        ```
        import object_detection
        ```
        
        
        ## What's in here
        
        * [setup.py](setup.py): The python packaging script.
        * [pb2](pb2): This directory contains the compiled protobuf files from the following commands.
        
        ```bash
        cd tf_object_detection/research/
        protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
        mv object_detection/protos/*_pb2.py ../../pb2/
        ```
        * tf_object_detection: A git submodule pointing to the version of tensorflow object detection this thin wrapper is for.

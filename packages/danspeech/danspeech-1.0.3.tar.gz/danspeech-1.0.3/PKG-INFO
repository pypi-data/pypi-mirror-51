        ## Demo
        To experience the danspeech package, we've created a simple demo with a nice GUI. It depends on danspeech 
        and django.
        
        The demo resides at [https://github.com/danspeech/danspeechdemo](https://github.com/danspeech/danspeechdemo).
        
        ## Train models
        If you wish to train your own models, or perhaps finetune a DanSpeech model to your specific use case, we then 
        refer to the [DanSpeech training repository](https://github.com/danspeech/danspeech_training). 
        
        ## Support
        If you require help with the software, then feel free to create issues here on github. We will continually solve issues
        and answer any questions that you might have.

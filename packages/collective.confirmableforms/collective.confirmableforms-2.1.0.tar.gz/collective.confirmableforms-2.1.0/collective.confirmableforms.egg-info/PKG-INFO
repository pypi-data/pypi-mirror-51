Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds a new emailer for Products.PloneFormGen. Our emailer
        is based on the default PFG one, but will first send an email to the
        person who submitted the form so he can confirm his email address.
        
        This products relies on PloneFormGen and collective.depositbox to
        store the data waiting for validation.
        
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        This has been tested with Plone 4.3 and PloneFormGen 1.7.
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Add ``collective.confirmableforms`` to your buildout and install it
        via Zope quick installer or Plone add-on control panel page.  First
        install ``PloneFormGen`` itself, then ``collective.confirmableforms``.
        
        
        Form setup
        ==========
        
        - Add a PloneFormGen form.
        
        - In this form, add a Confirmed Mailer Adapter.
        
        - On the Confirmation tab of this mailer, set a plain or html text
          that includes ``[[confirmation_link]]`` to display the confirmation
          link.
        
        - Remove any other action adapters from the form, especially the
          default Mailer Adapter, otherwise the other actions are executed
          anyway, even when the form has not been confirmed via email yet.
        
        - You probably want to edit the thanks page and say here that the user
          will be getting an email and should click on the link there.
        
        - You can add a second thanks page to say that the email has been succesfully confirmed.
          Edit the Confirmed Mailer Adapter and select this as thanks page on the confirmation tab.
        
        
        How it works for the visitor
        ============================
        
        - A visitor fills in the form and submits it.
        
        - The thanks page of the form is displayed.
        
        - The visitor gets an email with a link to confirm his input.
        
        - The visitor clicks on the link.
        
        - The normal part of the mailer kicks in, sending an email to an admin, or however you have set it up.
          This works the same as the default mailer.
        
        - The visitor sees the thanks page that is configured in the Confirmed Mailer Adapter.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.1.0 (2019-08-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Added fields for setting the confirmation email address.
          As fallback, use the standard recipent email address.
          Until now, we only used the address of the ``replyto`` field.
          [maurits]
        
        - Pass ``wrappedFields`` option to the confirm mailer templates.
          Same as PloneFormGen does for the standard mailer.  [maurits]
        
        
        2.0.0 (2018-02-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Added ``send_standard_mail`` boolean.  Default is true.
          If set, after the email address is confirmed, the standard mail is sent,
          as if this was a standard mail action adapter.
          [maurits]
        
        - Automatically ignore all other action adapters during first submission.
          Automatically ignore our ConfirmedFormMailerAdapter after confirmed submission.
          This makes it possible to have for example a Script adapter called only after confirmed submission.
          [maurits]
        
        - Automatically install PloneFormGen during our own install.
          This makes sure PloneFormGen is installed first.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.4.3 (2016-11-18)

        - Added more info in readme on how to use this.  [maurits]
        
        - Package cleanup. Added test extra, although we have no interesting tests.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.4.2 (2013-05-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not give our ConfirmedFormMailerAdapter a workflow.
          [maurits]

        ------------------
        
        - Remove implementedOrProvidedBy import from PloneFormGen that was only meant
          for Z2 interfaces compatibility. Removed from PFG 1.7.7.
          [fredvd]
        
        
        1.4 (2012-09-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Make the plain_mail and html_mail fields optional, but give a
          validation error when neither of them is filled in.
          [maurits]
        
        - Add a field to select a different thank-you page to show when the
          form has been confirmed.  Fall back to the standard thank-you page
          of the form or the fg_result_view page.
          [maurits]
        
        - When there is no plain text or no html text, do not send that part.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do not use a RichTextWidget for the html field.  Any tal tags
          would get stripped.
          [maurits]

# Nevolve - Neuro-Evolution for Humans

![Nevolve logo](nevolve-boring.png)

## You have just found Nevolve.
Nevolve is a Neuro-Evolution Library for __Reinforcement Learning__, written in Python, developed aiming at enabling rapid experimentation.

It implements *conventional neuro-evolution algorithm*, which evolves the strength of the connection weights for a fixed network topology. It initializes the Artificial Neural Network with random weights and evolves the weights using Neuro-Evolution.

Read the documentation at [Nevolve.ml](https://nevolve.ml).

Nevolve is compatible with: __Python 3.5 or greater__

## Getting started: 15 seconds to Nevolve

The core class of Nevolve is a __Population__, which organizes whole Neuro-Evolution process.

Here is the `Population` class:

```python
from nevolve.evolve.population import Population
```
A few sample environments are also provided in the library. CartPole environment is one of them. Here is the wrapper on `CartPole` environment from [OpenAi Gym](https://gym.openai.com/):

```python
from nevolve.envs.cart_pole_v0 import CartPoleV0
```

Create Population instance.

```python
model = Population(
    cls=CartPoleV0, 
    size=100, 
    mutation_rate=0.05, 
    max_workers=10
)
```

Start Evolution:

```python
model.evolve(
    max_generation=100,
    show_best=True
)
```

Results:
```
Generation: 1 | Best Fitness: 27.0
Generation: 2 | Best Fitness: 21.0
Generation: 3 | Best Fitness: 41.0
Generation: 4 | Best Fitness: 49.0
Generation: 5 | Best Fitness: 62.0
Generation: 6 | Best Fitness: 48.0
Generation: 7 | Best Fitness: 200.0
Generation: 8 | Best Fitness: 200.0
Generation: 9 | Best Fitness: 200.0
Generation: 10 | Best Fitness: 200.0

```

Once your model performs the best for you, save the best model with `.save_best_()`:

```python
model.save_best_(path="best_cart_pole.pkl")
```

## Installation

- **Install Nevolve from PyPI (recommended):**

Note: These installation steps assume that you are on a Linux or Mac environment.
If you are on Windows, you will need to remove `sudo` to run the commands below.

```sh
sudo pip install nevolve
```

If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:

```sh
pip install nevolve
```

- **Alternatively: install Nevolve from the GitHub source:**

First, clone Nevolve using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kaustubholpadkar/nevolve.git
```

 Then, `cd` to the nevolve folder and run the install command:
```sh
cd nevolve
sudo python setup.py install
```


------------------

## Future enhancement

- To add support for NEAT algorithm and its variations which can evolve the weights and the topology of the Neural Network.
- To Introduce some computational optimizations in Neural Network library and Evolutionary Algorithm.
- To Introduce a few new wrappers for OpenAI Gym and other environments.

------------------

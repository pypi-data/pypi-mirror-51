        **folderplay** is a small tool that helps you remember watched tv episodes. Its goal is to resume playback from the episode you left off with a single button press. It doesn't use any integrated players so you can still use your favourite one.

        ## üíæ Installation
        
        ### Using precompiled binaries
        
        Just go to the [releases](https://github.com/hurlenko/folderplay/releases) page and download the latest version for your platform.
        
        ### Using PyPi
        
        Use following command to download the latest version from PyPi:
        
        ```bash
        pip install folderplay
        ```
        
        Note, currently only `python3.7` is supported.
        
        ## üìô Usage
        
        Simply drop the executable into the directory where you media resides and run it. The application will scan all directories and subdirectories for known extensions.
        
        By default the app runs in `basic` view mode. You can toggle to the more advanced view by pressing the gear button. From there you can select the video player to use (`folderplay` will try to search for existing video players and will warn you on start up if it didn't find one).
        
        You can filter your media list using the search form. The list also has supports context menu with some handy commands.
        
        ## üî® Building
        
        Clone master branch or checkout a specific tag
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/hurlenko/folderplay.git
        ```
        
        Create new virtual environment inside of the `folderplay` directory
        
        ```bash
        python3.7 -m venv venv
        
        source venv/bin/activate # Linux / MacOs
        
        venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
        ```
        
        Install dependencies
        
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Now either run the application
        
        ```bash
        python -m folderplay
        ```
        
        Or create an executable (will be save inside of the `dist` directory)

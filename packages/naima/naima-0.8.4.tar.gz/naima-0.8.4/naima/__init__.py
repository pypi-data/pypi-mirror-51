`naima` is a Python package for computation of non-thermal radiation from
relativistic particle populations. It includes tools to perform MCMC fitting of
radiative models to X-ray, GeV, and TeV spectra using `~emcee`, an
affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov Chain Monte Carlo.  `naima` uses
MCMC fitting of non-thermal X-ray, GeV, and TeV spectra to constrain the
properties of their parent relativistic particle distributions.

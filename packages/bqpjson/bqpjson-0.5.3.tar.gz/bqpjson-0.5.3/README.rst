bqpjson is a minimalist python package for working with bqpjson data files, a json-based encoding of binary quadratic programs.  A detailed description of the bqpjson data format is available `here <http://bqpjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bqpjson_format.html>`_.  

The package can be installed via::

    pip install bqpjson


**The bqpjson toolset includes:**

- *bqpjson* - python tools for the validation and transformation of bqpjson data (`documentation <http://bqpjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_)
- *bqpjson-schema.json* - a JSON-Schema for bqpjson data files
- *spin2bool* - a command line tool for converting a bqpjson data files between the spin and boolean variable spaces
- *bqp2qh* - a command line tool for converting bqpjson data files into qubist compatible hamiltonians
- *bqp2qubo* - a command line tool for converting bqpjson data into qubo data
- *bqp2mzn* - a command line tool for converting bqpjson data into a minizinc model
- *bqp2hfs* - a command line tool for converting bqpjson data into hfs data


**An example of bqpjson data**::

    {
      "description":"a simple model",
      "id": 0,
      "linear_terms": [
        {"coeff":  1.3, "id": 2},
        {"coeff": -0.7, "id": 6}
      ],
      "metadata": {},
      "offset": 0.0,
      "quadratic_terms": [
        {"coeff": -0.2, "id_head": 4, "id_tail": 2},
        {"coeff":  1.5, "id_head": 6, "id_tail": 2}
      ],
      "scale": 1.0,
      "variable_domain": "spin",
      "variable_ids": [2,4,6],
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }

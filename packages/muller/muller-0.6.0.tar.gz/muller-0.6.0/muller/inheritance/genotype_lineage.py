		Orders genotypes by which background they belong to.
	Parameters
	----------

		The detection limit
	flimit: float
		The cutoff value to consider a genotype "fixed"
	additive_cutoff: float
		Used when testing whther a nested genotype is consistently greater than an unnested genotype
	subtractive_cutoff: float
		Used to test whether the combined frequencies of the nested/unnested genotype are consistently greater than the fixed cutoff.
	derivative_cutoff: float
		Used when testing whether two genotypes are correlated, not correlated, or anticorrelated. correlated/anticorrelated genotypes
		must have a covariance outside the range [-`derivative_cutoff`, `derivative_cutoff`].

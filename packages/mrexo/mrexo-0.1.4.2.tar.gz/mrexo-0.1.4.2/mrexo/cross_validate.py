    """
    We use k-fold cross validation to choose the optimal number of degrees from a set of input candidate degree values.
    To conduct the k-fold cross validation, we separate the dataset randomly into k disjoint subsets with equal
    sizes. Then we leave out the s-th subset, denoted by Ds (s = 1, . . . , k) and use the remaining k-1 subsets of data
    to estimate the weights of the beta densities (w_s). Repeating this for each s-th subset Ds results in k estimated sets of weights (w_s).
    We plug in each weight (w_s) along with the corresponding data, to obtain an estimated value for the log-likelihood.
    This log likelihood is maximized to pick the optimum number of degrees.

                  - 10 folds for n > 60, where n is the length of the Mass and Radius arrays.

        degree_candidates: Integer vector containing degrees to run cross validation check for. Default is None.
                    If None, defaults to 12 values between 5 and degree_max.

                bootstrap and the cross validation. Default=1.
                To use all the cores in the CPU, cores=cpu_count() (from multiprocessing import cpu_count)
        abs_tol : Absolute tolerance to be used for the numerical integration for product of normal and beta distribution.
                Default : 1e-8
        cores: this program uses parallel computing for bootstrap. Default=1
        save_path: Location of folder within results for auxiliary output files
        verbose: Integer specifying verbosity for logging.
        If 0: Will not log in the log file or print statements.

# Server-Side LaTeX Compilation for Pelican

This plugin hooks itself directly into docutils' reStructuredText parser to
compile math roles and blocks with [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) while
building your blog. Therefore, you do not need to ship the KaTeX javascript
implementation with your website anymore and improve the accessibility as well
as the load time of your internet presence.

## Installation

Run `pip install pelican-katex` and add `"pelican_katex"` to the `PlUGINS`
setting in your configuration file. Afterwards, you should be able to remove the
`katex.js` `<script>` tag from your template and your math should still look
fine.

## Configuration

The plugin offers several configuration options that you can set in your
`pelicanconf.py`.

```python
# Path to the katex file to use. This project comes with version `0.10` of
# katex but if you want to use a different one you can overwrite the path
# here. To use a katex npm installation, set this to `"katex"`.
# KATEX_PATH = "/path/to/katex.js"

# By default, this plugin will redefine reStructuredText's `math` role and
# directive. However, if you prefer to have leave the docutil's defaults
# alone, you can use this to define a `katex` role for example.
# KATEX_DIRECTIVE = "katex"

# Here you can pass a dictionary of default options that you want to run
# KaTeX with. All possible options are listed on KaTeX's options page,
# https://katex.org/docs/options.html.
# KATEX = {
#     # Abort the build instead of coloring broken math in red
#     "throwOnError": True
# }
```

Description: Importable GraphQL modules
        ==========================
        
        `gqlmod` allows you to keep your GraphQL queries in `.gql` files and import them
        as modules.
        
        * Validation of queries at import time
        * Validation of queries against the schema
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install both `gqlmod` and any providers you need. (The `starwars` provider ships
        with `gqlmod`, so you can begin playing with it immediately.)
        
        Define a `.gql` file with your queries and mutations, like so:
        
        ```graphql
        #~starwars~
        
        query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
          hero(episode: $ep) {
            name
            ... on Droid {
              primaryFunction
            }
            ... on Human {
              homePlanet
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        
        And then you can just import it and use it:
        
        ```python
        import gqlmod  # noqa
        from mygql import HeroForEpisode
        
        print(HeroForEpisode(ep='JEDI'))
        ```
        
        
        Why
        ---
        
        So why use this?
        
        * Strong validation as soon as possible (when the modules are imported)
        * All the work is done at warmup, not when the query is made
        * I think not mixing languages produces cleaner code?

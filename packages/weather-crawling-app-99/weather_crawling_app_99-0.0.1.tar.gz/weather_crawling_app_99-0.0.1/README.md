weather_crawling is a django based website crawler.
here we are trying to fetceh weather condition according to place,data,type
here the procedure is:-
we have a ui for filling a form that take input date,place,type
we are making an url from the site url for searching the weather condition of that perticular place
then it shows some result according to the seaching key word in the class name 'styles__itemLink__23h5a'
if the content under this class is empty then we work with default url(this may come generraly due to slow internet)
then we search result according to the type by if else condition
showing the results

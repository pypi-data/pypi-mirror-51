Description: File System Query. 
        
        Working with the file system is too verbose. 
              
        FSQuery provides a way of thinking about the file system inspired by JQuery.
              
        An FSQuery is created from a particular director with a number of terms added as modifiers. 
              
        A simple example : 
              
            from fsquery import FSQuery
            
            fsq = FSQuery("/home/myaccount").NoFollow(".git").Ext(".py").FileOnly()
            for n in fsq :
                print(n.abs)
              
        
        This FSQuery searches all directories under /home/myaccount, except directories with ".git" in their name.
        
        It matches files with a ".py" extension. And the FileOnly() suppresses returning directories.
        
        See more documentation on the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/interstar/FSQuery).

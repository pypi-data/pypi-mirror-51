Converter benchmarking
===========================

Converter have a default method.

Notem however, that several methods may be available.
Moreover, you may have a method that you want to compare
with the implemented one. To do so you will need to 
implement your method first. Then, simply use our benchmarking
framework as follows.

from bioconvert.bam2cov import BAM2COV
from bioconvert.fastq2fasta import FASTQ2FASTA

#####################################################
# Get the convert you wish to benchmark
input_file = bioconvert_data("test_measles.sorted.bam")
conv = BAM2COV(input_file, "test.cov")
#input_file = bioconvert_data("test_fastq2fasta_v1.fastq")
#conv = FASTQ2FASTA(input_file, "test.fasta")


#####################################################
# Get the Benchmark instance
bench = Benchmark(conv)
bench.plot()

# You can now see the different methods implemented in this
# converter and which one is the fastest.

* 4.3.5 - Aug 19 2019

- Increase times in unit tests to ensure passing on slow systems

- Allow instantiating  FunctionTimedOut exception without arguments ( will replace function name with "Unknown Function" and timedOutAfter with "Unknown" when absent)

- Update runTests.py from latest GoodTests distrib, 3.0.5 from 2.1.1


* 4.3.4 - Aug 19 2019

- Merge patch by Rafal Florczak to use threading.Thread.is_alive vs now deprecated threading.Thread.isAlive

- Regenerate docs


* 4.3.3 - May 13 2019

- More documentation updates


* 4.3.2 - May 13 2019

- Update docs, update README, note that this still works with Python 3.7

- Update link to pydocs to be on githubpreview, as python hosted is broke right now.


* 4.3.0 - Aug 10 2017

- Ensure that functions wrapped with @func_set_timeout do not lose meta
information (such as name, docstrings, etc.). Special thanks to belongwqz on
github for noting the issue and suggesting functools.wraps


* 4.2.0 - Jun 4 2017
- Add "stop" method to StoppableThread (same as previous _stopThread method -
but with a 'public' name)
- Document StoppableThread a lot more
- Add "raiseEvery" to StoppableThread.stop to control the "repeatEvery" arg to
JoinThread (how often after the first raise the exception is retried)

* 4.1.0 - May 24 2017

- If func_timeout completes the function call in the alloted time, explicitly
clean up the thread (previously we were only cleaning it up in the time-out
path). On python3 it would get cleaned up anyway on the next garbage
collection cycle, on python2 it's a bit more finnikey (but will also,
eventually, get automatically joined)

- Be better at the traceback. Exclude the funcwrap from the call, and ensure
the raised Exception follows the actual path of execution (can be confusing to
read at first glance, but your function is at the bottom, then goes around a
bit.)

This uses PEP409/3134 in Python3 (available in 3.3+, we support 3.4+
officially).

Python2 doesn't have this, but has it's own syntax that doesn't work in
python3 to allow throwing a custom __traceback__.

You'd think both would support both, or at least python3 support both...

Anyway, this causes a kinda silly import-hack and adds an extra frame to the
exception handling part, but works to prevent default handlers from picking it
up.

This solves the multiple prints of exceptions on python3 in certain
circumstances(you catching and then raising an exception)


* 4.0.0 - May 20 2017

- Fixup short delay after a thread times out

- Fix where in some cases (depending on what was execution when abort was

called), a default handler could print the tracback to stderr outside of the
scope of the normal raise (it would still be raised, just handled twice).

- Add a function decorator which provides a default timeout, allows that
timeout to be overriden by adding a "forceTimeout" kwarg to the function
(configurable), or even running a function to calculate the timeout based on
args for each call

- Some improvements to python2 support

- Add GoodTests (Unit tests)

* 3.1.0 - Jan 4 2017
- Make windows compatible 
- Add simple testcase, "testit.py"

* 3.0.1 - Mar 21 2016
- Update documentation

* 3.0.0 - Mar 18 2016
- Change implementation to not leave lingering threads after a timeout occurs
- Split module into several parts
- Exportable "StoppableThread" impl, I may release later as a standalone
package.

* 1.0.1 - Mar 15 2016
- Remove debugging print
- Note that it has been explicitly tested on 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 in README.
- Add link to pydoc in README

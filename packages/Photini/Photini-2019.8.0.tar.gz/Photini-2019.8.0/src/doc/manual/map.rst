Geotagging
==========

The map tabs allow you to set the location of where a photograph was taken.
Photini currently uses four different map providers: Google, Bing, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap (OSM).
All four tabs have similar functionality, but have different styles and levels of detail.
Google, Bing, and Mapbox also offer aerial (or "satellite") photography.

The map initially displays the previously used location.
You can change the view by zooming in or out, or by panning the map by dragging it with the mouse.
However, it's usually easier to find a specific location by using the search facility.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_131.png

Click on the ``<new search>`` edit box and type in a search term such as the name of a town, then press the 'return' key.
A drop down list of place names should appear, from which you can select one.
Note that the search box may be disabled for a few seconds after each search to limit the load on the free servers that provide the service.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_132.png

The search is influenced by the current location shown on the map.
A search for 'newport' may return different results if the map is showing New York than if it's showing London.
You can do a world wide search, ignoring the current location, by clicking on the ``<widen search>`` item in the drop down list.
Alternatively you can drag the map to somewhere near where you want to be and then click on the ``<repeat search>`` item in the drop down list.

Each map provider has its own search facility.
You may get more useful results by switching to a different map tab.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_133.png

Having found the right town, you can then zoom in and pan around to find the exact location where your photograph was taken.
Using aerial / satellite imagery can help with this.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_134.png

Now you can drag and drop your photograph onto the map to set its location.
To set the same location on multiple images, select them all and then drag and drop one of them.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_135.png

.. |flag| unicode:: U+02690

Note that photographs that have location data are shown with a flag symbol (|flag|) in the image selector area.

The location coordinates are shown in the ``Lat, long:`` box.
These values are editable, so you can set the location of photographs directly, e.g. by copying and pasting from another one.
You can also adjust the location by dragging the marker on the map.
To clear a photograph's location data just delete the coordinates.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_136.png

When several photographs have location metadata Photini will pan the map (and zoom out if required) to ensure all the selected images are shown on the map.
Selected images are shown with coloured markers.
Unselected images are shown with grey markers.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_137.png

Selecting another map tab will show the same location but with data and imagery from a different provider.

GPX file import
---------------

If you have a mobile phone or other device with a GPS logger you may be able to set the approximate locations of photographs from logged GPS positions.
If you have installed gpxpy_ then Photini's ``File`` menu should have an ``Import GPX file`` item.

First you need to export your GPS log as a ``GPX`` (GPS eXchange format) file, then transfer the .gpx file to your computer.
Make sure your images have the correct time zone set so that Photini can calculate their UTC timestamps.
Select the images you want to set the locations of, then click the ``Import GPX file`` menu item.

After opening your GPX file you can set some options to filter out inaccurate points.
``Max time between points`` allows Photini to detect gaps in the log, e.g. when you were in a building and lost the GPS signal.
``Max dilution of precision`` allows you to ignore points where the "dilution of precision" (see `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision_(navigation)>`_) is too large.
You may need to experiment to find the best value for your GPS device.
The final option selects whether to plot the track on the current map tab.
This is still experimental, and there isn't an option to delete the plot, but it may be useful when setting the previous two parameters.

Photini will use the GPS track to estimate the location of each selected image with a timestamp near enough to that of a logged position.
Linear interpolation or extrapolation is used, based on the timestamps of the two nearest logged positions.
The result is unlikely to be the exact location where you took the photograph, so you will almost certainly want to adjust the positions by dragging markers on the map.

.. note::
   This is a recent addition to Photini and has not been extensively tested.
   I'd be interested to hear if you find it useful.

Address lookup
--------------

Photograph metadata can include textual address elements as well as the latitude & longitude.
These are stored in a 5-level hierarchy: ``street``, ``city``, ``province``, ``country`` and ``region``.
The meaning of these terms is rather loose, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no requirement to fill them all in.
Typically ``city`` can be anything from a village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, e.g. "23 Abdication Avenue".
``Province`` would be a state in the USA or a county in the UK.
``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 letter ISO code.
``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a continent or sub-continent.
More detail about these can be found on the `IPTC web site <https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/documentation/userguide/index.htm#!Documents/locations.htm>`_.

Photini stores two types of address: ``camera`` is where the photographer was positioned and ``subject`` is a location being photographed.
For example, a general view of the Eiffel Tower will almost certainly have been taken from somewhere else in Paris.
This separation of camera and subject addresses was added to the IPTC specification in 2009, but you may still have software that only recognises "legacy" address metadata.
In this case you should not use the ``subject`` tabs or ``region`` fields.
(Note that although the address metadata is standardised by the IPTC, it's actually stored in the XMP data.)

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_140.png

The ``â‡¨ address`` button uses "reverse geocoding" to convert latitude & longitude into a hierarchical address.
This is a rather imprecise process so you may need to edit the results yourself.
All the map tabs use the same address lookup service provided by OpenCage_, using data from OpenStreetMap_.
Other providers don't allow lookup results to be permanently stored.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_141.png

It's easier to see the address data if you drag the divider between address data and map to the right.
Here you can see there is some duplication as a result of the imprecision of address lookup.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_142.png

It is usually necessary to edit the address quite a lot.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_143.png

Right-clicking on a location tab displays a context menu that allows the tab to be copied to a new tab or deleted.
Copying the ``camera`` location is an easy way to initialise a ``subject`` location.
(An empty ``subject 2`` tab is immediately created, in case the photograph has more than one subject.)

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_144.png

In this case most of the data is the same, but I changed the ``street`` to the subject of the photograph rather than where I was standing.

.. image:: ../images/screenshot_145.png

To reorder the subject locations, or to convert between camera and subject, you can drag any of the tabs to another position.
If this results in the rightmost tab having data then another tab will be added.
If the two rightmost tabs have no data then one of the empty tabs will be removed.

Clone the repo\n1. Run the source locally: `poetry run python dj`\n1. Test the source: `poetry run pytest`\n1. Build and install locally: `poetry build && pip3 install --user --upgrade --force-reinstall dist/dj_command-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`\n1. Test with `~/.local/bin/dj migrate`\n1. Publish the source to pypi: `poetry publish --build --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD`\n\n# Acknowledgements\n- [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/): please, please, please continue to wrangle the complexity of 1) creating Python projects, and 2) installing dependencies; seriously, it\'s baffling out there without you\n- [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/): ridiculously full-featured library to help implement CLI programs in Python; it has all the bells and most of the whistles\n- [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/): would you like easy classes in Python? yes, please\n- [delegator.py](https://github.com/amitt001/delegator.py): dealing with subprocess is a pain, but delegator hides all the ugly cruft behind a nice API\n\n# Prior art\nThis isn\'t a new idea and there are a few other implementations out there that do similar things. But, uh, I like mine. ðŸ˜€\n- [dj-cmd](https://pypi.org/project/dj-cmd/)\n- [Django-dj](https://github.com/h4l/Django-dj)\n- [dj-cli](https://pypi.org/project/dj-cli/)\n',

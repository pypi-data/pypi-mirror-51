Description: # Coriolis
        
        ## What is it ?
        `coriolis` is a quick visualization python software developped using PyQt5 and xarray. 
        It allows the user to get a quick insight of a NetCDF (.nc) file.
        
        It provides multi-dimensional field main statistics, an embedded matplotlib canvas 
        to visualize the data (1-D and 2-D plots) and some features to save
        the figure, scale the data, change the colorbar, use non-linear axis scales and others
        
        An animation widget is also implemented. However, at this point, matplotlib is not fast enough to enable a 
        confortable and quick visualization refreshment. Other software such as NcView should be used instead.
        
        More importantly, `coriolis` allows the user to precisely select the data to plot, namely the needed slices
        can be easily given.

        ## How to install it ?
        
        You need to install the dependencies before installing the package. They were
        not included within the package due to some issues with pip-installed PyQt5
        package.
        We recommend therefore the Anaconda distribution for installing those dependencies.
        
        In a pre-activated python3 environment, you can simply do :
        
        ``` 
        $ conda install matplotlib xarray netcdf4 cartopy`
        $ pip install coriolis
        ```
        
        
        ##Â How to use it ?
        
        As for now, only NetCDF (.nc) files can be processed.
        
        You can use the software by running the command :
        
        `$ coriolis yourfile.nc`
        
        ## How to customize it ?
        
        If you want to customize the figures style, 
        you can modify the custom.mplstyle file which is in the package.

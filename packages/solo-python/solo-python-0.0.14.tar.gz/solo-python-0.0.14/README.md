# Python tool and library for SoloKeys

## Getting Started
We require Python >= 3.6 and corresponding `pip3` command.

We intend to support Linux, Windows and macOS. Other platforms aren't supported by the [FIDO2 library](https://github.com/Yubico/python-fido2) we rely on.

To get started, run `pip3 install solo-python`, this installs both the `solo` library and the `solo` interface.

Possible issues:

- on Linux, ensure you have suitable udev rules in place: <https://github.com/solokeys/solo/blob/master/99-solo.rules>
- on Windows, optionally install a libusb backend: <https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#driver-installation>

For development, we suggest you run `make init` instead, which

- sets up a virtual environment
- installs development requirements such as `black`
- installs `solo` as symlink using our packaging tool `flit`, including all runtime dependencies listed in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)

One way to ensure the virtual environment is active is to use [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

## Solo Tool
For help, run `solo --help` after installation. The tool has a hierarchy of commands and subcommands.

Example:

```bash
solo ls  # lists all Solo keys connected to your machine
solo version  # outputs version of installed `solo` library and tool

solo key wink  # blinks the LED
solo key verify  # checks whether your Solo is genuine
solo key rng hexbytes  # outputs some random hex bytes generated on your key
solo key version  # outputs the version of the firmware on your key
```

## Firmware Update

Upon release of signed firmware updates in [solokeys/solo](https://github.com/solokeys/solo),
to update the firmware on your Solo Secure ("regular" version) to the latest version:

- update your `solo` tool if necessary via `pip3 install --upgrade solo-python`
- plug in your key, keeping the button pressed until the LED flashes yellow
- run `solo key update --secure`

To update an (unmodified) Solo Hacker, instead run `solo key update --hacker`.

For possibly helpful additional information, see <https://github.com/solokeys/solo/issues/113>.

## Library Usage

The previous `solotool.py` has been refactored into a library with associated CLI tool called `solo`.

It is still work in progress, example usage:

```python
import solo

client = solo.client.find()

client.wink()

random_bytes = client.get_rng(32)
print(random_bytes.hex())
```

Comprehensive documentation coming, for now these are the main components

- `solo.client`: connect to Solo Hacker and Solo Secure keys in firmware or bootloader mode
- `solo.dfu`: connect to Solo Hacker in dfu mode (disabled on Solo Secure keys)
- `solo.cli`: implementation of the `solo` command line interface

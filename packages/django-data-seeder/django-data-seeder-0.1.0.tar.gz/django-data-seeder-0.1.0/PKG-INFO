Description: ==================
        django-data-seeder
        ==================
        
        This app provides a simple way of seeding data for your data models into your
        development or test database. This can be achieved through the Admin site, via
        a management command, or by writing your own scripts that use a seeder object.
        
        It is often necessary to be able to seed large datasets, especially in complex
        projects, where having pre-loaded data can save time in the development
        lifecycle. Additionally, by allowing simple data seeding, you can more
        effectively conduct load tests or test complex edge case scnearios.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Django 2.2+
        * Python 3.6+
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install ``data_seeder`` using ``pip``
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install django-data-seeder
        
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        1. Add ``data_seeder`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``
        
           .. code-block:: python
        
             INSTALLED_APPS = [
               ...
        
               'data_seeder',
             ]
        
        2. Seed data with the following command
        
           .. code-block:: bash
        
             python manage.py seeddata [options] app.models.Model [app.models.Model2, ...]
        
           This will generate a single seed for each model provided.

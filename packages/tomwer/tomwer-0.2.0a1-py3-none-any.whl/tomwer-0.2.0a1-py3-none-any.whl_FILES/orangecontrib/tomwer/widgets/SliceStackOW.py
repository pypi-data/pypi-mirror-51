    This widget will make copy or virtual link to all received *slice* files

    Options are:
       - copy files or create sym link (set to sym link)
       - overwrite if existing (set to False)
    
    Behavior:
        When the process receives a new data path ([scanPath]/[scanID]) and if 
        no output folder has been defined manually them it will try to create
        the folder [scanPath]/slices if not existing in order to redirect
        the slices files.
        If fails will ask for a directory.
        If the output folder is already existing then move directly to the
        copy.

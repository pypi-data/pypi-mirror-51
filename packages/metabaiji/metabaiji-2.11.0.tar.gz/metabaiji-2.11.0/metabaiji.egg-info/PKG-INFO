        This is an active fork of `baiji <https://github.com/bodylabs/baiji>`__,
        a high-level Python abstraction layer for Amazon S3:
        
        1. An
           ```open`` <https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open>`__-like
           context handler which allows using S3 keys and local files
           interchangeably.
        
           -  When reading S3, contents are first written to a temporary local
              file.
           -  When writing S3, contents are written to a temporary local file,
              and uploaded on close.
        
        2. An ``s3`` CLI for listing, copying, syncing, and other common
           activities.
        
        The fork’s goals are modest:
        
        -  Keep the library working in current versions of Python and other
           tools.
        -  Make bug fixes.
        -  Provide API stability and backward compatibility with the upstream
           version.
        -  Respond to community contributions.
        
        It’s used by related forks such as
        `lace <https://github.com/metabolize/lace>`__.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Works without an S3 connection (with local files).
        -  Supports multiprocess parallelism for copying lots of files.
        -  Supports Python 2.7 and uses boto2.
        -  Supports OS X, Linux, and Windows.
        -  Tested and production-hardened.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        .. code:: py
        
           with s3.open('s3://example/info.txt', 'w') as f:
               f.write('hello')
        
           with s3.open('file:///home/me/info.txt', 'w') as f:
               f.write('hello')
        
           with s3.open('s3://example/info.txt', 'r') as f:
               contents = f.readlines()
        
           with s3.open('file:///home/me/info.txt', 'r') as f:
               contents = f.readlines()
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           s3 cp foo.txt s3://example/bar.txt
           s3 cp s3://example/bar.txt s3://another-example/bazinga.txt
           s3 rm s3://example/bar.txt
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
           rake test
           rake lint
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        1. Migrate credentials to ``~/.aws/credentials`` or env, and deprecate
           AWS credential support in ``~/.bodylabs``.
        2. Move ``baiji.util.parallel`` into a separate library.
        3. Upgrade to boto3.

Description: =======
        autolux
        =======
        
        inspired by `lumen <https://github.com/anishathalye/lumen>` but written for
        \*nix machines. autolux takes a screenshot every few seconds, figures out the
        'average value' of the resulting image (the **luminence**) and changes the
        screen brightness based on the screen's contents.
        
        
        installation
        ------------
        
          pip install autolux
        
        dependencies
        ------------
        
        * python2 (not python3)
        * python-daemon (optional, for running as a service)
        * imagemagick (for screenshots + determining average brightness)
        * xdotool (finding focused window)
        * xbacklight (for setting display brightness)
        
        usage
        -----
        
        
        ::
        
            # runs autolux
            autolux
        
        or
        
        ::
        
            # running autolux as a service
            autolux --daemon
        
        
        xrandr
        ------
        
        if your display does not support hardware adjustment through xbacklight,
        its possible to use xrandr to adjust the brightness via software.
        
        
        ::
        
            # find out the display of your name using xrandr
            xrandr --listmonitors
        
            autolux --xrandr eDP1 # my monitor is named eDP1
            autolux --xrandr eDP1 --reset # reset brightness to normal
            autolux --xrandr eDP1 --adjust -1 # lower brightness by 1
            autolux --xrandr eDP1 --adjust +1 # increase brightness by 1
        
        
        model
        -----
        
        initially, autolux uses linear interpolation to figure out the brightness to
        map to different luminence inputs. as the brightness is manually adjusted away
        from its predicted value, autolux records the time of day and luminence values
        that prompted you to change the brightness level and integrates the new
        information into its model.
        
        autolux assumes that time of day and screen content are the sole predictors of
        one's preferred brightness, but the model could further be improved by adding
        in several factors, such as **ambient light** or **user active time** (as a
        stand-in for eye strain). because of these and other unknown confounding
        variables, autolux has an emphasis on quick learning of new preferences and not
        burning in old ones.

        ::
        
            # color is the input luminence. (5K - 65K, lower value is darker screen content)
            # x axis is hour (0 - 24, with UTC offset applied)
            # y axis is predicted brightness level from the model (0 - 100%)
        
        
            autolux --vis --plot-luma
            # --plot-luma will swap the luma and brightness on the Y axis and colorbar

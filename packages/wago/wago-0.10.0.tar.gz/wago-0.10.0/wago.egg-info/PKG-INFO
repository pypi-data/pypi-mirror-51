        ====
        
        Welcome to `Wago <http://github.com/M-o-a-T/wago>`__!
        
        This library controls access to I/O on Wago controllers.
        These are industrial devices with various analog and digital extension modules
        and run a basic embedded Linux; older models don't even have a MMU.
        
        A small control program needs to run on them.

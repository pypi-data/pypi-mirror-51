## Installation

Download the source code (as zip, or by cloning). Go into the directory with a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

Add any lab extensions you need to phoila:

```bash
phoila install <lab-extension name> [<lab-extension name> ...]
```

(if you don't need any extensions, make sure to run `phoila build` instead)

Then run it:

```bash
phoila
```


## Components

Phoila consists of the following parts:
- An application entry point (`phoila` that points to `phoila.app:main`).
  This starts a server application, with the main handler on
  `<base_url>/phoila`. This page serves a custom JupyterLab/Phosphor app.
  It also adds other JupyterLab handlers to the app.
- Subcommands for the application that install and remove extensions in
  the custom lab app. This includes `phoila install <extension name>`,
  `phoila build`, etc.
- A custom server handler and lab extension for showing Voila templates.
  This includes a custom jupyter-widgets (ipywidgets) manager for rendering widgets. This view differs from the preview extension in Voila in the
  different dashboards aren't rendered in an iframe, so the static assets
  are shared across the different dashboards.

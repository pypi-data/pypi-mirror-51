This is a formatter for Python code that adheres to the PEP8 standards.  
It will indent classes, functions, loops, and conditional statements 
with 4 spaces and will break a line longer than 72 characters.  
This project is still in developement and is being updated constantly.

How to Use:
	When writing python code to be formatted with Aqua, it is
	important to leave one blank line after an indented block ends.
	This tells Aqua that the next line should not be indented.  If
	code is written immediately after a block is supposed to end,
	it will be indented as part of the block. The blank line tells
	Aqua that the block has ended.

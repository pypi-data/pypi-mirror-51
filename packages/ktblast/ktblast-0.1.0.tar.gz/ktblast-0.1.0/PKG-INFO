Description: k-t BLAST
        =========
        
        Python implementation of several k-t BLAST-like MR reconstruction
        algorithms.
        
        Currently included modules are:
        
        - UNFOLD
        - k-t BLAST
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        See examples module and doc strings -- both good resources for full
        arguments list and usage.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # UNFOLD algorithm
            from ktblast import unfold
        
            sx, sy, st = kspace[:]
            recon = unfold(kspace, time_axis=-1)
        
            # k-t BLAST algorithm
            from ktblast import ktblast
        
            sx, sy, st = kspace[:]
            sx, sy, st = calib[:]
            recon = ktblast(kspace, calib, psi, time_axis=-1)
        
        
        About
        =====
        
        I couldn't find any implementation of these algorithms that were
        easy to get up and running in Python, so I decided to write my own.

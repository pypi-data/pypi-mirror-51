Split picking
-------------

This module adds a "Split" button on the outgoing pickings form.

It works like the classical picking Transfer but it leaves both
pickings (picking and its backorder) as confirmed without
processing the transfer.

Installation
============

This module only needs `stock` module.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* When splitting a picking in an unassigned state, wizard won't
  be auto completed with picking lines.

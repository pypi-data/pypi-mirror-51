# dbt-mssql

dbt-mssql is a custom adapter for [dbt](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt) that adds support for Microsoft SQL Server versions 2008 R2 and later. pyodbc is used as the connection driver as that is what is [suggested by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/python-driver-for-sql-server). The adapter supports both windows auth, and specified user accounts.

dbt-mssql is currently in a beta release. It is passing all of the [dbt integration tests](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-integration-tests/) on SQL Server 2008 R2. Considering Microsoft's legendary backwards compatibility, it should work on newer versions, but that testing will come in the near future. 

## Connecting to SQL Server

Your user profile (located in `~/.dbt/profile`) will need an appropriate entry for your package. 

Required parameters are:

- driver
- host
- database
- schema
- one of the login options:
  - SQL Server authentication
    - username
    - password
  - Windows Login
    - windows_login: true

**Example profile:**

The example below configures a seperate dev and prod environment for the package, _foo_. You will likely need to alter the `driver` variable to match whatever is installed on your system. In this example, I'm using version 17, which is the newest on my system. If you have something else on your system, it should work as well.

```yaml
foo:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: mssql
      driver: 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server'
      host: sqlserver.mydomain.com
      database: dbt_test
      schema: foo_dev
      windows_login: True
    prod:
      type: mssql
      driver: 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server'
      host: sqlserver.mydomain.com
      database: dbt_test
      schema: foo
      username: dbt_user
      password: super_secret_dbt_password
```

## Jaffle Shop

Fishtown Analytic's [jaffle shop](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop) package is currently unsupported by this adapter. At the time of this writing, jaffle shop uses the `using()` join, and `group by [ordinal]` notation which is not supported in T-SQL.

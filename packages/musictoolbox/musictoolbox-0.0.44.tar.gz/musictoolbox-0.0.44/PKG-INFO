Description: Music toolbox
        =============
        
        This is a small toolbox of utilities written in Python 2 that help users groom their music collection.
        
        What's in the box
        -----------------
        
        `syncplaylists` takes a number of file lists / playlists in the command line,
        and a destination directory, then synchronizes all the songs in the playlists
        to the destination directory, with optional modifications to the files and their
        names as they are copied to the destination directory.  `syncplaylists` preserves
        your music collection's directory structure.
        
        `syncplaylists` requires a simple INI file in your home directory (name it
        `.syncplaylists.ini`) which must say how you want things to be transcoded:
        ::
        
            # cat .syncplaylists.ini
            [transcoding]
            mp3=copy
            m4a=copy
            ogg=copy
            flac=copy
            *=mp3
            opus=copy
        
        Once you've created the INI file, here's the quickstart version of how you
        actually *use* the tool:
        
        ```
        [user@laptop ~/Music]$ syncplaylists -vd Playlists/*.m3u /mnt/usbdrive/Music/
        ```
        
        That will copy all songs listed in all M3U playlists within your
        `~/Music/Playlists` folder directly into `/mnt/usbdrive/Music`, preserving
        the directory structure you have.
        
        Run `syncplaylists --help` or see `get_parser()` in file `synccli.py` for more
        information.
        
        `genplaylist` generates playlists.  Run `genplaylist --help` or see
        `get_parser()` in file `genplaylist` for more information.
